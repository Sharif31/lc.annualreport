            Every page of the Logistics Cluster 2019 report is a testament to the power of partnership.  From Rumbek to Rome, Gonaives to Geneva, Ngala to New York, the strength of the Logistics Cluster community shines through.  Whether working together in the field to find timely ways to transport life-saving cargo or brainstorming together to define a multi-year humanitarian logistics strategy, everyone has played their part.  It has only been possible to find practical, timely logistics solutions to help our less fortunate fellows to overcome increasing adversity, because the Logistics Cluster is able to draw power from its diversity.  The Logistics Cluster is not an elite members-only club but an inclusive team of partners united by a common goal.  Each partner brings whatever they have: resources, experience, innovation, local knowledge.  When this is combined with the common energy generated by collaboration and commitment, we have a recipe for effective and efficient action.

            In the following pages, and through the words of the partners themselves, you will read about a humbling and inspiring range of activities.  It is not possible to single out one operation over another but the Mozambique response provided a clear example of how the Logistics Cluster worked together.  In the words of our outgoing Global Coordinator, Stephen Cahill, this was possible as the Logistics Cluster is “..very diverse, pulling together a team from different parts of the world..”

            As we enter the “Decade of Action” the need to pull together as one is stronger than ever.  The 2019 Annual Report gives us great hope that this it is within our reach to make a difference if we continue to work together.  A huge thanks to everyone for their friendship, collaboration and unity of purpose.
