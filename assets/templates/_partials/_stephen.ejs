          enables global, regional and local actors to meet humanitarian needs. Before crises, we work with the stakeholders in high risk countries and regions to strengthen local logistics capacities. In crises, where these capacities have been exceeded, we provide leadership, coordination, information and operational services.

          Globally, the Logistics Cluster is a community of partners actively working to overcome logistics constraints, develop and share best practices and solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="serif">
          The cluster approach was adopted in 2005 as a result of the Humanitarian Reform process launched by the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC). The Reform process focused on strengthening coordination and accountability, enhancing partnerships in key sectors, including Logistics.

          Because of its expertise in humanitarian logistics and its field capacity, the UN World Food Programme was chosen by the IASC to be the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster. In this role, when necessary, WFP acts as a provider of last resort, offering common logistics services,  to all humanitarian responders.

          The Logistics Cluster leverages the network of sixty active partners to best fill critical logistics gaps. When local infrastructure is severely damaged or inaccessible and local capacities exceeded, WFP, as the lead agency of the cluster, acts as a provider of last resort, offering assets and services to the humanitarian responders to enable them to reach the affected population. The Logistics Cluster coordinates access to common road transport services, storage facilities and fuel provided by WFP or any organisation with relevant available capacity.
        </p>
        <p class="serif">
          The Logistics Cluster is therefore key to ensuring an efficient humanitarian response, reducing duplication of humanitarian efforts and saving costs.
