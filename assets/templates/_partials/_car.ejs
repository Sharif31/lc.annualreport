        <p>The Logistics Cluster has been playing an important role in supporting organisations to identify gaps and optimise the use of resources available at regional and local levels.</p>
        <p>
          Due to insufficient funding, the Logistics Cluster has been operating with minimal staff throughout 2016, restricting the effectiveness of critical coordination efforts <br>
          and the capacity to provide real-time information and data to the humanitarian community.
