        <p>
          Since November 2017, the escalation of tensions and violence between non-state armed groups and security forces in the North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon have caused the significant displacement of people. </p>
        <p>
            Cameroon’s North-West and South-West regions host four million inhabitants and while it is unknown exactly how many have been impacted by the recent wave of violence, it is estimated that over 400,000 people have been displaced, and over one million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including host communities and the neighbouring Littoral and West regions. 
          </p>
        <p>
            On 17 October, eight clusters, including the Logistics Cluster, were activated in response to the crisis in the Northwest and Southwest. I landed in Yaoundé one month later, following two colleagues who had already been deployed as surge capacity two weeks earlier to conduct the first assessments, reach out to partners on the ground and lay the basis for our response.
        </p>
        <q>
            After a couple days of meeting with partners in Yaoundé, I moved to Buea which has become the hub of the humanitarian response in the South-West. It is from here that we work to support local and international NGOs and UN agencies, and to gather and analyse all the information that we then share on the cluster website. 
        </q>
        <p>
            We chose to focus on these tasks in the first weeks following the cluster activation, in an effort to address the lack of logistics coordination and reliable information which can contribute to a slowdown of the response and the inefficient use of resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, we have also been assessing infrastructure, including available logistics facilities such as warehouses, in the South-West. As we gain a better understanding of the humanitarian needs and the requirements of the responding organisations, we are more accurately able to define a plan of activities for 2019.

        <small><i>A bridge rehabilitation project was included in the initial requirement, however due to operational changes this support was finally not required. Therefore, the Logistics Cluster activities in Iraq in 2017 were fully funded.</i></small>
