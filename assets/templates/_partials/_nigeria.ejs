        <p>
            When I joined the WFP Nigeria Country Office in December 2016, Logistics Sector operations in support of the government-led response in the north-east of the country had only recently begun. Since then, the sector has provided increased support to humanitarian organisations responding to a complex crisis which affects more than 7.7 million people, many of whom are temporarily sheltered in isolated and hard-to-reach areas. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw the sector operation quickly evolving into a complex response entailing different services provided by different organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each month, the Logistics Sector civil-military coordination team processes approximately 500 movement notifications through the Nigerian Armed Forces. These notifications are consolidated and sorted into a weekly dispatch plan that is then used to organise humanitarian convoys. In 2018, 5,637 notifications, encompassing 17,356 trucks, were processed on behalf of 32 organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
            While en route to final distribution points, organisations can temporarily store their cargo in common storage facilities strategically located along the supply routes. These facilities are operated by ACTED, Première Urgence Internationale (PUI), INTERSOS, Solidarités International and eHealth Africa, and from January to December, 29,684 m<sup>3</sup> of relief goods were received for storage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given the security risks and the poor road infrastructure, critical humanitarian aid such as medicines and therapeutic food supplements is also regularly airlifted from Maiduguri to remote locations throughout Borno state. PUI, in partnership with UNHAS, operates a sector-managed common road transport service in Maiduguri, to collect and consolidate cargo destined for air transport, and deliver it to the airport so that it is ready to be airlifted by UNHAS to identified hard-to-reach locations. In 2018, 21 organisations arranged delivery of their cargo to UNHAS via this service.
        </p>

        <p>
            I recently re-joined the Global Logistics Cluster and, among other tasks, I am in charge of providing support to the Nigeria operation. 
        </p>

            My knowledge of the country and of the wider humanitarian response there has proved very useful. Nigeria is a very complex operating context where needs and priorities are constantly evolving, hence we heavily rely on our staff on the ground to make the everyday choices necessary to keep our response relevant and efficient.
