			  In 2019, the Logistics Cluster continued to monitor the situation in Cameroon which is experiencing the impact of three distinct, complex humanitarian crises fuelled primarily by violence and insecurity. The cluster was activated in October 2018, specifically in relation to the North-West South-West crisis which saw insecurity and attacks against civilians cause mass movements of people.

			  A Coordinator and an Information Management Officer were deployed to Cameroon to meet with partners and conduct a logistics gaps and needs analysis. Following consultations with humanitarian organisations working on the response as well as with the WFP Country Office, the in-country commercial logistics capacity was found to be sufficient to meet humanitarian needs and no additional cluster activities were required. The cluster was therefore moved to a dormant status.
