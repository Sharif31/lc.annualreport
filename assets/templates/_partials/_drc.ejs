        <p>
          Conflict and general insecurity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have created one of the world’s most complex and long-standing humanitarian crises.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In order to support the humanitarian community in responding to the crisis the Logistics Cluster is operational in Kinshasa and in the provincial capitals of Bukavu, Goma, Bunia, Kalémie and Lubumbashi. </strong> It coordinates the logistical aspect of the response and provides the critical information required to improve the access and delivery of relief items to the affected population. Since violent clashes erupted in Kasai, causing a severe humanitarian crisis in the region and major displacement the Logistics Cluster has been stepping up its operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Two staging areas for the humanitarian community</strong> have been set up for in Kananga (1,520 m2) and Tshikapa (880 m2) and are managed by WFP and Handicap International-Atlas Logistique. Logistics Cluster staff are present in Kananga to help manage the supply chain and provide technical assistance to partners.
        <p>
          <strong>Road transport services have also been made available to humanitarian organisations by Handicap International-Atlas Logistique </strong> and a civil-military expert has been deployed to the Logistics Cluster to facilitate civil-military coordination.
        </p>
        <p>
          These common logistics services have been managed using the Logistics Cluster run Relief Items Tracking Application (RITA) to ensure full accountability of the cargo handled.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, the Logistics Cluster has also been supporting the Ebola response in the Bas Uele Province. The outbreak was successfully contained thanks to rapid and coordinated operations. The cluster provided logistics coordination and Information Management at national and provincial levels and facilitated air cargo movements to the affected zones.

        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the Logistics Cluster has continued to work with national authorities to <strong>build institutional capacity in disaster response and mitigation</strong>, as well as to strengthen local capacities in data collection and data management, <strong>with 183 people from 46 organisations trained</strong> in dedicated trainings in Bukavu, Butembo, Kananga, Kinshasa, Tshikapa.
