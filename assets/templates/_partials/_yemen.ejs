            The Logistics Cluster has been active in Yemen since June 2011, supporting humanitarian responders with information management, coordination and access to common logistics services. Throughout this period the situation in Yemen has remained volatile, conflict has escalated, and multiple crises have affected the country, including cholera outbreaks, internal displacements and natural disasters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been there for most of it, first on temporary assignment, then posted in Sana’a as Cluster Coordinator and saying that this is a complex emergency is an understatement; humanitarian needs are enormous and the capacity of responding organisations is strained.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, the cluster ensured the continued transport of relief items into the country through air services that connect Djibouti to Sana’a and sea services that connect Djibouti to Aden and Hodeidah. 1,081 mt of cargo was transported using WFP-chartered flights, and 2,430 mt of cargo was transported on board two WFP-chartered vessels, as well as dhows. Cargo has included medicines and medical equipment, vaccines, bed nets, generators, solar vaccine refrigerators, and even ambulances.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, we coordinated the transport of 12,005 mt of humanitarian supplies on behalf of 23 organisations to 288 locations across the country, and facilitated access to common warehouse facilities in Sana’a, Aden and Hodeidah, where 62,435 m<sup>3</sup> of cargo was accepted into storage on behalf of 17 organisations.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cluster also mobilised 15 MSUs for organisations to borrow and deploy where most needed, to be managed by these organisations as common storage for all interested humanitarian responders. As of December 2018, seven MSUs have been loaned to IRC, DRC, UNICEF, ADRA and WHO.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add to the complexity, following the escalation of conflict around Hodeidah in June and the subsequent increase of humanitarian activities targeting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), the Logistics Cluster has been tasked with coordinating Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) deliveries to Humanitarian Service Points and Transit Points, established to provide IDPs with relief items. 
        </p>
        <q>
            The Logistics Cluster was committed to commonly address the real needs of humanitarian organisations during the emergency response in Yemen this year. The transportation services for medical aid provided by the Logistics Cluster is one of the key elements that really impacts the design of the medical supply chain of MDM and adds value for our operation. Working together as partners, we succeeded in delivering more than 50 tonnes of medicines and medical aid by cluster air & sea freight transportation from the Djibouti Hub to both the North & South of Yemen. Thanks to the Logistics Cluster in Yemen for facilitating our humanitarian operation
