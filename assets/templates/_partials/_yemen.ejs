        <h1 class="title hidden-md-down">Yemen</h1>
        <p>
          Since March 2015, Yemen has seen a dramatic escalation of armed conflict that has led to mass displacements, a socio-economic situation near collapse, and a drastic deterioration in food security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responding organisations have been facing critical challenges such as damaged road infrastructure, access disruptions, congestion at main entry points, limited international shipping options (especially by air) and fuel shortages. In 2017, the largest cholera outbreak ever recorded demanded a logistics scale-up to ensure that humanitarian organisations could deliver efficient and effective assistance to the affected population.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2015, the Logistics Cluster has facilitated access to common logistics services to maximise the use of available resources in-country, and avoid duplication of efforts. <strong>These services include sea transport of relief items from Djibouti to Aden and Hodeidah, storage in the three hubs of Sana’a, Hodeida and Aden, overland transport inside Yemen, and fuel provision to humanitarian organisations.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster also coordinates access to chartered airlifts, provided to the humanitarian community by WFP Aviation, from Djibouti to Sana’a. The frequency of the airlifts increased in 2017 from about one airlift per month in the first half of the year to a peak of four flights per week in August, as a result of the <strong>cholera epidemic</strong>, which required urgent transport of Health and WASH cargo. From August onwards, cargo flights settled on an average of two per month.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since May 2016, the Logistics Cluster also coordinates a passenger movement service between Djibouti and Aden on the WFP-chartered vessel VOS Apollo, which transports on average more than <strong>100 passengers each month; 34 organisations (UN agencies, INGOs, NNGOs) used the service in 2017.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this common services platform, in 2017, the Logistics Cluster ensured an integrated supply chain of humanitarian cargo in support of over 50 organisations (including organisations accessing emergency fuel made available by WFP, as well as organisations using the sea passenger service).
