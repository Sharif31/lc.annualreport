      <h1 class="title">The Logistics Cluster</h1>
      <p class="serif">
        enables global, regional and local actors to meet humanitarian needs. Before crises, we work with stakeholders in high risk countries and regions to strengthen local logistics capacities. In crises, where these capacities have been exceeded, we provide leadership, coordination, information and operational services.

      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        Globally, the Logistics Cluster is a community of partners actively working to overcome logistics constraints, and to develop and share best practices and solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The cluster approach was adopted in 2005 as a result of the Humanitarian Reform process launched by the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC). The reform process focused on strengthening coordination and accountability and enhancing partnerships in key sectors, including Logistics.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        Because of its expertise in humanitarian logistics and its field capacity, the UN World Food Programme was chosen by the IASC to be the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster. In this role, when necessary, WFP acts as a provider of last resort, offering common logistics services  to all humanitarian responders.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The Logistics Cluster leverages the network of sixty active partners to best fill critical logistics gaps. When local infrastructure is severely damaged or inaccessible and local capacities have been exceeded, WFP, as the lead agency of the cluster, acts as a provider of last resort, offering assets and services to humanitarian responders to enable them to reach the affected population. The Logistics Cluster coordinates access to common road transport services, storage facilities and fuel provided by WFP or any organisation with relevant, available capacity.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The Logistics Cluster is therefore key to ensuring an efficient humanitarian response, reducing duplication of humanitarian efforts and saving costs.

        <p>
            In August 2017, within the space of a single month, 500,000 Rohingya people fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state seeking safety in Bangladesh.</p>
          <p>
              After one year, it was estimated that the number of new arrivals had reached approximately 907,000 with 14,922 since January 2018. Humanitarian organisations operating in Cox’s Bazar, in support of the government-led response, currently target 1.3 million people for humanitarian assistance, including host communities in the area.
          </p>
          <q>
              Before joining the Logistics Cluster, I was working with WHO, therefore I was acquainted with the reality and challenges of working in an emergency. However, the setting of Cox’s Bazar was daunting and, in my new role as Information Management Officer for the Logistics Sector, I had to learn how to make use of my skills and experience to coordinate with a large number of different partners. 
          </q>
          <p>
              The Logistics Sector in Bangladesh supports over sixty humanitarian organisations and government institutions with critical common logistics services and key information, such as access constraints maps.
          </p>
          <p>
              In 2018, the Logistics Sector coordinated the storage of 25,343 m<sup>3</sup> of relief items, including some 40,000 soap bars, over 10,000 blankets and 8,000 winter clothing items for children, on behalf of 23 different actors including national and international NGOs, and UN agencies. To handle common storage needs, three logistics hubs have been established in Cox’s Bazar since September 2017: Ukhiya and Madhu Chara, provided by WFP, and Teknaf, managed by Handicap International/Atlas Logistique. To allow for the return of the land back to the Ukhiya Degree College, Ukhiya Logistics Hub was phased out of service in October 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
              Further support has been provided through the loaning of 30 containers in several locations for the storage of rapid response goods, with 11 Mobile Storage Units also made available to the humanitarian community as required. 
          </p>
          <p>
              The common facilities have also been used to support organisations with the prepositioning of relief items as part of monsoon season preparation plans. The country’s exposure to natural hazards, such as heavy rains during the monsoon and cyclone seasons which cause flooding and infrastructure damage, coupled with the temporary nature of many settlements and shelters, presents a continuous challenge to humanitarian logistics operations, making preparedness actions vitally important.

        <p>
          Since November 2017, the escalation of tensions and violence between non-state armed groups and security forces in the North-West and South-West regions of Cameroon have caused the significant displacement of people. </p>
        <p>
            Cameroon’s North-West and South-West regions host four million inhabitants and while it is unknown exactly how many have been impacted by the recent wave of violence, it is estimated that over 400,000 people have been displaced, and over one million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including host communities and the neighbouring Littoral and West regions. 
          </p>
        <p>
            On 17 October, eight clusters, including the Logistics Cluster, were activated in response to the crisis in the Northwest and Southwest. I landed in Yaoundé one month later, following two colleagues who had already been deployed as surge capacity two weeks earlier to conduct the first assessments, reach out to partners on the ground and lay the basis for our response.
        </p>
        <q>
            After a couple days of meeting with partners in Yaoundé, I moved to Buea which has become the hub of the humanitarian response in the South-West. It is from here that we work to support local and international NGOs and UN agencies, and to gather and analyse all the information that we then share on the cluster website. 
        </q>
        <p>
            We chose to focus on these tasks in the first weeks following the cluster activation, in an effort to address the lack of logistics coordination and reliable information which can contribute to a slowdown of the response and the inefficient use of resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, we have also been assessing infrastructure, including available logistics facilities such as warehouses, in the South-West. As we gain a better understanding of the humanitarian needs and the requirements of the responding organisations, we are more accurately able to define a plan of activities for 2019.

        <h1 class="title hidden-md-down">Central African Republic (CAR)</h1>
        <p>
            I arrived in CAR at the end of August 2018 straight from Nigeria, where I had been the Sector Coordinator for two years.
        </p>
        <q>
            I am not new to the Logistics Cluster, or to a context where logistics constraints, poor infrastructure and fragile security make it difficult for humanitarian assistance to reach beneficiaries, but CAR has its own specific challenges. 
        </q>
        <p>
            The Logistics Cluster has been active in the country since 2013 in support of the humanitarian community, coordinating a logistics platform, as well as providing common transport and storage services. These services are managed by different organisations based on their capacity and presence on the ground, thus ensuring the best use of resources and the efficient delivery of humanitarian aid. 

        </p>
        <p>
            In Nigeria we had a similar setting, but while the sector’s main focus in Northern Nigeria is to address the lack of storage facilities, in CAR the primary logistics needs are related to the transport of humanitarian cargo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Road transport of relief items from Bangui, Bambari and Bossangoa is led by Humanity and Inclusion while Première Urgence Internationale is in charge of storage in Bangui. In addition, Solidarités International, Humanity and Inclusion and Action Contre la Faim manage Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) loaned by WFP in Kaga Bandoro, Bambari and Bossangoa respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these common services, 2,041 mt of humanitarian cargo was transported and 17,807 m<sup>3</sup> of humanitarian cargo was stored across the common facilities in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the Logistics Cluster also facilitates emergency airlifts managed by WFP which deliver lifesaving items to hard-to-access areas in the east of the country, including to Bangassou, Zemio, Obo, Alindao, Bria and Birao. These services started in September 2017 and continued throughout 2018 facilitating the transport of 365 mt of humanitarian aid to six locations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Transport to hard-to-reach locations is integrated with common storage space through three MSUs deployed to Zemio, Alindao and Bambari which are managed by ACTED, Action Contre la Faim and Humanity and Inclusion respectively.

        <h1 class="title hidden-md-down">DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC)</h1>
        <p>
            The DRC is affected by an extremely complex and long-standing humanitarian crisis requiring continuous efforts from organisations on the ground to respond to the needs of the affected population. 
        </p>
        <q>
            I have been working on the DRC response for more than two years, since I was part the Red Cross Movement, and I’ve learned first-hand that to be relevant, the humanitarian response needs to be continuously readjusted. 
        </q>
        <p>
            This is because of the complexity of the operating context, but also because of the multiple crises affecting the country such as spikes in conflict, population displacements and health emergencies which generate new needs and priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Logistics Cluster is operational in Kinshasa and in the provincial capitals of Bukavu, Goma, Bunia, Kalémie and Kananga, providing information management and coordination to support the humanitarian actors involved in the response. Our staff on the ground regularly share useful logistics information – such as storage capacity, access updates and logistics maps – enabling responders to plan their operations while taking into consideration the available logistics capacity, road accessibility and access constraints.
        <p>
            The cluster has also been working on strengthening local capacity by providing training sessions dedicated to building information management, GIS and logistics skills which are critical to improving the quality of the response.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2017, following the worsening of the situation in the Kasai region the cluster began facilitating access to common storage and transport services provided by WFP and Humanity and Inclusion in Kananga and Tshikapa. This scale-up of activities required additional capacity on the ground and strengthened support from the Global Support team.
        </p>
        <p>
            From January to June, 4,120 m<sup>3</sup> of relief items were received into storage and 6,199 m3 of cargo was transported to different locations across the country. In total, 32 organisations used these logistics services.

        <p>
            A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Indonesia’s Central Sulawesi province on 28 September 2018, triggering a tsunami and landslides that caused widespread destruction and loss of life, as well as the displacement of over 200,000 people. The earthquake affected the west coast of Donggala, while the tsunami affected the bay of Palu. In addition, the coastline of Palu City and Sigi district was affected by liquefaction.
        </p>
        <q>
            I was in Lebanon, working with the Logistics Cluster as an Information Management Officer for the Syria response, when I was asked to deploy as surge capacity to support the government-led response, so off I went, with very little notice, to my first emergency deployment.
        </q>
        <p>
            The first task was to work with the Government of Indonesia and humanitarian organisations responding to the emergency to coordinate the logistics response and provide information to actors on the ground. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, we started assessing the logistics capacity and gaps in the affected areas. Based on our findings and the flow of relief items and the constraints in accessing the affected population, we identified the need for common logistics services. In response, WFP, as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, made road transport and temporary storage available to the humanitarian community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We worked closely with local and international NGOs, the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) and UN agencies including UNICEF and UNHCR. Activities were focused on facilitating access to transport and storage services for requesting organisations and governmental bodies. A fleet of 40 trucks was deployed to facilitate deliveries to different locations within Sulawesi, as well as to common warehouse facilities; 939 mt of relief items were transported using these assets. In addition, six MSUs were set-up in Garuda, in the centre of Palu city, for the onward movement of relief supplies to further destinations and in just two months 4,862 m3 of humanitarian cargo was received into storage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, we supported the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB), led by the national logistics cluster, informing government strategy as requested, and providing coordination and information management from Central Sulawesi and from Jakarta. Information on the pipeline for relief items, transport plans, existing stocks, port infrastructure and access constraints was collected and shared with relevant governmental bodies.

        <p>
          As the context within Iraq shifts to early recovery efforts, logistics coordination remains key in ensuring that the needs related to these new humanitarian activities are met, while the capacity and resources to address the regular relief efforts are maintained.
          </p>
        <p>
          Despite the improving security situation in some areas, insecurity does still remain a challenge along with bureaucracy which creates access limitations. This has a serious impact on the humanitarian supply chain in-country, hampering the timely movement of goods, humanitarian staff, and the provision of services.
        </p>
        <q>
          In my role as Logistics Cluster Coordinator, I have been working with humanitarian responders and government bodies to clarify import and clearance procedures for different entry points and routes and have defined capacity building initiatives for the government and national actors.
        </q>
        <p>
          We have also continued to support humanitarian organisations with customs clearance procedures through the established One Stop Shop (OSS). The OSS provides a free-of-charge service which includes the facilitation of customs clearance for incoming cargo into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, and coordination with authorities for the smooth movement of humanitarian aid. This year the OSS processed 688 clearance requests, representing almost 10,000 mt and US$ 99 million of humanitarian cargo.
        </p>
        <p>
          While addressing these access issues we continued to facilitate storage in key areas, allowing humanitarian responders to position relief cargo closer to beneficiaries. From January to December 2018, the Logistics Cluster received 29,387 m<sup>3</sup> of humanitarian relief items for storage, on behalf of 24 organisations. During the same period, the Logistics Cluster provided up to 11,620 m<sup>2</sup> of common storage space in six locations in key operational areas including Ninewa, Salah al Din and Duhok governorates, as well as loaned 15 MSUs to eight different actors.

        <h1 class="title hidden-md-down">Libya</h1>
        <p>
            Libya has faced six years of political instability, conflict and insecurity, alongside a deteriorating public sector and economy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is estimated that 800,000 people, including refugees, migrants, internally displaced persons, returnees, non-displaced affected people and host communities, will require urgent humanitarian assistance throughout 2019. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Prospects remain uncertain in the medium and long term, while fighting and recurrent shifts in areas of control are expected to impact the humanitarian operational environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            A growing need for stronger logistics coordination and information sharing among responding actors was identified, primarily to address gaps in the overall humanitarian logistics knowledge and ensure a more coordinated operational response.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was deployed to Libya as Logistics Sector Coordinator in September after three years with the Logistics Cluster in Iraq, in order to facilitate the establishment of a centralised information sharing mechanism that could collect, analyse and share information on key logistics aspects such as the status of the entry points, supply routes, humanitarian customs procedures and other administrative processes that could cause significant delays to the arrival of relief supplies.
        </p>
        <q>
            After initial rounds of consultations with partners on the ground, I was able to institute regular coordination meetings, start mapping strategic logistics infrastructure and compile guidance and Standard Operating Procedures on customs and clearance procedures. 
        </q>
        <p>
            Based on the gaps and needs identified by humanitarian organisations, I am now working to secure common logistics services that will allow for the prepositioning of emergency stocks in the main hubs of Tripoli, Benghazi and Sebha, and for emergency distributions where needed most.
        </p>
        <p>
            Engagement and coordination among partners remains critical in identifying operational bottlenecks in this volatile environment, and in avoiding duplication of efforts to ensure the best use of available resources in-country. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To date, the Logistics Sector has connected with 26 humanitarian organisations operating across Libya, launched a dedicated webpage, held monthly coordination meetings, and produced and shared 22 information management products.

        <p>
            When I joined the WFP Nigeria Country Office in December 2016, Logistics Sector operations in support of the government-led response in the north-east of the country had only recently begun. Since then, the sector has provided increased support to humanitarian organisations responding to a complex crisis which affects more than 7.7 million people, many of whom are temporarily sheltered in isolated and hard-to-reach areas. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw the sector operation quickly evolving into a complex response entailing different services provided by different organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each month, the Logistics Sector civil-military coordination team processes approximately 500 movement notifications through the Nigerian Armed Forces. These notifications are consolidated and sorted into a weekly dispatch plan that is then used to organise humanitarian convoys. In 2018, 5,637 notifications, encompassing 17,356 trucks, were processed on behalf of 32 organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
            While en route to final distribution points, organisations can temporarily store their cargo in common storage facilities strategically located along the supply routes. These facilities are operated by ACTED, Première Urgence Internationale (PUI), INTERSOS, Solidarités International and eHealth Africa, and from January to December, 29,684 m<sup>3</sup> of relief goods were received for storage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given the security risks and the poor road infrastructure, critical humanitarian aid such as medicines and therapeutic food supplements is also regularly airlifted from Maiduguri to remote locations throughout Borno state. PUI, in partnership with UNHAS, operates a sector-managed common road transport service in Maiduguri to collect and consolidate cargo destined for air transport, and deliver it to the airport so that it is ready to be airlifted by UNHAS to identified hard-to-reach locations. In 2018, 21 organisations arranged delivery of their cargo to UNHAS via this service.
        </p>

        <p>
            I recently re-joined the Global Logistics Cluster and, among other tasks, I am in charge of providing support to the Nigeria operation. 
        </p>

            My knowledge of the country and of the wider humanitarian response there has proved very useful. Nigeria is a very complex operating context where needs and priorities are constantly evolving, hence we heavily rely on our staff on the ground to make the everyday choices necessary to keep our response relevant and efficient.

        <p>
            I joined the Logistics Cluster team in South Sudan as an Information Management Officer in September 2018, after having served in Central African Republic in the same capacity. 
        </p>
        <q>
            Despite my previous experience in a complex emergency, nothing really prepares you for a challenging, large-scale operation such as South Sudan where we provide a full range of common, integrated services.
        </q>
        <p>
            In 2018 alone, in close collaboration with OCHA and the WFP Access Unit, we coordinated 51 convoys on behalf of the humanitarian community. This figure is double what was achieved last year and is a constant effort in coordination. The convoy schedule was significantly increased between January and March to maximise the use of the roads during the dry season and to facilitate prepositioning of goods in areas that become hard-to-reach or even cut off during the rainy season. We must be both flexible and alert to maximise use the window of opportunity the dry season presents, while also minimising risks.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the physical access issues which are exacerbated by the rainy season, the Logistics Cluster also facilitates air transport all year long to priority locations through dedicated assets made available by WFP Aviation. This allowed the transport of 5,262 mt of relief cargo to hard-to-reach locations in 2018. These air services are complemented by IOM Common Transport Services which provide shunting to and from airstrips along with transport to closed sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            River transport through barges is also made available to move larger payloads of Non-Food Items. In 2018, 1,015 mt of relief items were transported along the Nile River across seven barge movements from Bor to Malakal in close cooperation with WFP.
        </p>
        <p>
            To complement transportation services, WFP, as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, has made common storage warehouses available to the humanitarian community in several locations across the country and provided MSUs for the strategic prepositioning of relief items. MSUs are a critical part of the relief supply chain - it is where the humanitarian action takes shape.

            The Logistics Cluster was activated in Syria in January 2013 to facilitate access to crucial logistics services for all operations across the region.
        </p>
        <q>
            I became Deputy Cluster Coordinator in Damascus in January 2016 before becoming Cluster Coordinator in May 2017. Since then we have been adjusting our strategy, and consequently our operations, to respond to the different needs arising as a consequence of the conflict.  
        </q>
        <p>
            In 2018 we provided coordination support for cross-border operations and transhipment services from Turkey, Iraq and Jordan for a total of 5,042 trucks. In Jordan, this service was provided until June 2018, with transhipment and transport into southern Syria managed by IOM at Al-Ramtha crossing point. In Turkey and Iraq, transhipment at the crossing points of Bab al Hawa, Bab al Salam and Al Yaroubiyah is managed by WFP.
        </p>
        <p>
            Within Syria, we have been providing common transport and storage services. Together with OCHA and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), we coordinated Inter-Agency humanitarian convoys to hard-to-reach locations and besieged areas, and facilitated access to free-to-user transport to Qamishli, Deir-ez-Zor, Eastern Ghouta, and other newly-accessible areas using WFP assets. A total of 18 humanitarian convoys were coordinated in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            Making use of WFP warehouses in Aleppo, Homs, Lattakia, Qamishli, Rural Damascus and Tartous, the Logistics Cluster has coordinated the prepositioning of inter-agency cargo, as well provided temporary storage of relief items before their onward movement to further destinations and distribution points. In 2018, a total of 23,101 m<sup>3</sup> of relief items were stored in these common warehouses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, to ensure the effective coordination of a complex response that extends across three countries, and all the accompanying complications of border crossings and different customs regulations, we have worked to maintain a strong regional information management and coordination system.

        <p>
            The Logistics Cluster has been active in Yemen since June 2011, supporting humanitarian responders with information management, coordination and access to common logistics services. Throughout this period the situation in Yemen has remained volatile, conflict has escalated, and multiple crises have affected the country, including cholera outbreaks, internal displacements and natural disasters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been there for most of it, first on temporary assignment, then posted in Sana’a as Cluster Coordinator and saying that this is a complex emergency is an understatement; humanitarian needs are enormous and the capacity of responding organisations is strained.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, the cluster ensured the continued transport of relief items into the country through air services that connect Djibouti to Sana’a and sea services that connect Djibouti to Aden and Hodeidah. 1,081 mt of cargo was transported using WFP-chartered flights, and 2,430 mt of cargo was transported on board two WFP-chartered vessels, as well as dhows. Cargo has included medicines and medical equipment, vaccines, bed nets, generators, solar vaccine refrigerators, and even ambulances.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, we coordinated the transport of 12,005 mt of humanitarian supplies on behalf of 23 organisations to 288 locations across the country, and facilitated access to common warehouse facilities in Sana’a, Aden and Hodeidah, where 62,435 m<sup>3</sup> of cargo was accepted into storage on behalf of 17 organisations.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cluster also mobilised 15 MSUs for organisations to borrow and deploy where most needed, to be managed by these organisations as common storage for all interested humanitarian responders. As of December 2018, seven MSUs have been loaned to IRC, DRC, UNICEF, ADRA and WHO.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add to the complexity, following the escalation of conflict around Hodeidah in June and the subsequent increase of humanitarian activities targeting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), the Logistics Cluster has been tasked with coordinating Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) deliveries to Humanitarian Service Points and Transit Points, established to provide IDPs with relief items. 
        </p>
        <q>
            All of these achievements, which come despite the difficulties we have faced this year, have only been possible thanks to our dedicated staff who every day take responsibility for coordinating the cluster activities on the ground, and to WFP Management’s constant support of our operations.

            But technology cannot replace the knowledge, experience and determination of those who work every day for and with the people we serve. Their long-term commitment and dedication makes a difference that cannot and should not go unnoticed.

            This is why I would like the Logistics Cluster staff directly involved in our operations to tell you about our achievements in 2018. With their words and through their experiences, I am sure that you will be able to fully appreciate the breadth of our contribution to the successful implementation of humanitarian activities in some of the world’s most complex operational environments.
