      <h1 class="title">The Logistics Cluster</h1>
      <p class="serif">
        enables global, regional and local actors to meet humanitarian needs. Before crises, we work with stakeholders in high risk countries and regions to strengthen local logistics capacities. In crises, where these capacities have been exceeded, we provide leadership, coordination, information and operational services.

      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        Globally, the Logistics Cluster is a community of partners actively working to overcome logistics constraints, and to develop and share best practices and solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The cluster approach was adopted in 2005 as a result of the Humanitarian Reform process launched by the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC). The reform process focused on strengthening coordination and accountability and enhancing partnerships in key sectors, including Logistics.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        Because of its expertise in humanitarian logistics and its field capacity, the UN World Food Programme was chosen by the IASC to be the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster. In this role, when necessary, WFP acts as a provider of last resort, offering common logistics services  to all humanitarian responders.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The Logistics Cluster leverages its network active partners to best fill critical logistics gaps. When local infrastructure is severely damaged or inaccessible and local capacities have been exceeded, WFP, as the lead agency of the cluster, acts as a provider of last resort, offering assets and services to humanitarian responders to enable them to reach the affected population. The Logistics Cluster coordinates access to common transport services (road, river, sea and air), storage facilities and fuel provided by WFP or any organisation with relevant, available capacity.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The Logistics Cluster is therefore key to ensuring an efficient humanitarian response, reducing duplication of humanitarian efforts and saving costs.

            Ten per cent of the world's population is still living in extreme poverty and at least two billion people live in areas affected by conflict, fragility and violence. 
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            The Global Humanitarian Overview estimates that in 2019, more than 122 million people will need humanitarian assistance and protection, the majority because of the impact of conflict and violence.
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            Additionally, disasters caused by natural hazards stress economies and resilience systems. The World Bank has calculated that disasters push 26 million people into poverty every year.
          </p>
          <q>
            We are witnessing extremely high levels of humanitarian needs. 
          </q>
          <p class="serif">
            While this poses a great challenge for the humanitarian community and its ability to respond, the humanitarian system is more effective and impactful today.
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            Thanks to the digital transformation of our work, to cutting-edge solutions and their application to supply chain and to satellite communication, we are better at identifying target groups, their specific needs, and we are quicker to respond when crises strike.
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            But technology cannot replace the knowledge, experience and determination of those who work every day for and with the people we serve. Their long-term commitment and dedication makes a difference that cannot and should not go unnoticed.
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            This is why I would like the Logistics Cluster staff directly involved in our operations to tell you about our achievements in 2018. With their words and through their experiences, I am sure that you will be able to fully appreciate the breadth of our contribution to the successful implementation of humanitarian activities in some of the world’s most complex operational environments.

          <p>
            The Global Strategic Advisory Group (GSAG) was created in 2016 to foster shared ownership of the Logistics Cluster through representing the community of partners and providing strategic guidance to the Global Logistics Cluster Support Team.
		  </p>
		  
          <p>
			2019 was a year of translating vision and ambitions into workplans and concrete guidance. The GSAG held two face-to-face meetings and eleven teleconferences, providing guidance and leadership across a range of topics including Global Logistics Meetings and the Logistics Cluster Strategy. It revised the TORs of both the GSAG itself and the Logistics Cluster Global Working Groups, both of which were presented to and endorsed by the community of partners. 
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
			Anyone can utilise the GSAG as their representative body to put issues on the Logistics Cluster Agenda. The members can be contacted through <a href="mailto: sag-logs@logcluster.org ">sag-logs@logcluster.org </a>
		  </p>

		  <q>
            For me, it’s really a privilege and a responsibility to represent my peers’ views in the GSAG, and to help steer the Logistics Cluster for the benefit of all partners

				Recent changes to the GSAG composition include the addition of Deputy Head of Logistics Division for the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW), Theo Lingens, as new governmental organisation representative, Logistics Cluster Coordinator in the Central African Republic, Katja Hildebrand, as Field Cluster Coordinator representative, Global Logistics Cluster Coordinator Athalie Mayo as fixed chair, and Logistics and Procurement Manager for GOAL, Mary Jelliti, as NGO representative.

        <p>
            In August 2017, within the space of a single month, 500,000 Rohingya people fled Myanmar’s Rakhine state seeking safety in Bangladesh.</p>
          <p>
              After one year, it was estimated that the number of new arrivals had reached approximately 907,000 with 14,922 since January 2018. Humanitarian organisations operating in Cox’s Bazar, in support of the government-led response, currently target 1.3 million people for humanitarian assistance, including host communities in the area.
          </p>
          <q>
              Before joining the Logistics Cluster, I was working with WHO, therefore I was acquainted with the reality and challenges of working in an emergency. However, the setting of Cox’s Bazar was daunting and, in my new role as Information Management Officer for the Logistics Sector, I had to learn how to make use of my skills and experience to coordinate with a large number of different partners. 
          </q>
          <p>
              The Logistics Sector in Bangladesh supports over sixty humanitarian organisations and government institutions with critical common logistics services and key information, such as access constraints maps.
          </p>
          <p>
              In 2018, the Logistics Sector coordinated the storage of 25,343 m<sup>3</sup> of relief items, including some 40,000 soap bars, over 10,000 blankets and 8,000 winter clothing items for children, on behalf of 23 different actors including national and international NGOs, and UN agencies. To handle common storage needs, three logistics hubs have been established in Cox’s Bazar since September 2017: Ukhiya and Madhu Chara, provided by WFP, and Teknaf, managed by Handicap International/Atlas Logistique. To allow for the return of the land back to the Ukhiya Degree College, Ukhiya Logistics Hub was phased out of service in October 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
              Further support has been provided through the loaning of 30 containers in several locations for the storage of rapid response goods, with 11 Mobile Storage Units also made available to the humanitarian community as required. 
          </p>
          <p>
              The common facilities have also been used to support organisations with the prepositioning of relief items as part of monsoon season preparation plans. The country’s exposure to natural hazards, such as heavy rains during the monsoon and cyclone seasons which cause flooding and infrastructure damage, coupled with the temporary nature of many settlements and shelters, presents a continuous challenge to humanitarian logistics operations, making preparedness actions vitally important.

            I arrived in CAR at the end of August 2018 straight from Nigeria, where I had been the Sector Coordinator for two years.
        </p>
        <q>
            I am not new to the Logistics Cluster, or to a context where logistics constraints, poor infrastructure and fragile security make it difficult for humanitarian assistance to reach beneficiaries, but CAR has its own specific challenges. 
        </q>
        <p>
            The Logistics Cluster has been active in the country since 2013 in support of the humanitarian community, coordinating a logistics platform, as well as providing common transport and storage services. These services are managed by different organisations based on their capacity and presence on the ground, thus ensuring the best use of resources and the efficient delivery of humanitarian aid. 

        </p>
        <p>
            In Nigeria we had a similar setting, but while the sector’s main focus in Northern Nigeria is to address the lack of storage facilities, in CAR the primary logistics needs are related to the transport of humanitarian cargo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Road transport of relief items from Bangui, Bambari and Bossangoa is led by Humanity and Inclusion while Première Urgence Internationale is in charge of storage in Bangui. In addition, Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) loaned by WFP are managed by Solidarités International in Kaga Bandoro, and in Bambari and Bossangoa by Humanity and Inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these common services, 2,041 mt of humanitarian cargo was transported and 17,807 m<sup>3</sup> of humanitarian cargo was stored across the common facilities in 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the Logistics Cluster also facilitates emergency airlifts managed by WFP which deliver lifesaving items to hard-to-access areas in the east of the country, including to Bangassou, Zemio, Obo, Alindao, Bria and Birao. These services started in September 2017 and continued throughout 2018 facilitating the transport of 365 mt of humanitarian aid to six locations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Transport to hard-to-reach locations is integrated with common storage space through three MSUs deployed to Zemio, Alindao and Bambari which are managed by ACTED, Action Contre la Faim and Humanity and Inclusion respectively.

        <p>
			In 2019, ongoing insecurity and a continuing outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) contributed to a continued volatile humanitarian situation in DRC. With 12.8 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, humanitarian organisations operated in an extremely challenging and complex environment, facing access challenges and limited logistics infrastructure. The Logistics Cluster worked with a total of 203 organisations across the country, providing key coordination and information management services as well as advocating for urgent infrastructure rehabilitation projects throughout the year. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Humanitarians working on the response in DRC, are facing major access constraints across an area that is the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa. Timely and accurate logistics information provided through the Logistics Cluster is critical to strengthen operational decision-making. In 2019, a total of 237 information management updates were published on a dedicated webpage, including 97 maps detailing accessibility and other general logistics information. 
		</p>
        <q>
            I have been working on the DRC response for more than two years, since I was part the Red Cross Movement, and I’ve learned first-hand that to be relevant, the humanitarian response needs to be continuously readjusted. 
        </q>
       <p>
		Effective information sharing and coordination is also crucial to avoid duplication of efforts and to capitalise on the collective presence. The Logistics Cluster continued to work with the humanitarian community throughout the country and held 55 coordination meetings across the seven locations of Kinshasa, Goma, Bukavu, Ituri, Tshikapa, Kananga and Kalemie, where humanitarian organisations could exchange information on logistics issues and challenges. In 2019, a new mechanism was established to co-facilitate the country-level meetings in Kinshasa with an NGO. Humanity and Inclusion shouldered the role as the first NGO co-facilitator in-country. 
	   </p>
	   <p>
		The lack of a reliable road network across the country complicated the humanitarian response and lead to high operating costs. The Logistics Cluster continued to advocate on behalf of the humanitarian community for the rehabilitation of roads and bridges as a means to improving humanitarian access both in the short and long term. 
	   </p>
	   <p>
		A total of 51 rehabilitation projects were carried out by Logistics Cluster partners this year over the year, including project EMIR and the rehabilitation of 1,200 kilometers of road and the runaway of Tshikapa airport.

			  The DRC is affected by an extremely complex and long-standing humanitarian crisis requiring continuous efforts from organisations on the ground to respond to the needs of the affected population. 
		  </p>
		  <q>
			  I have been working on the DRC response for more than two years, since I was part the Red Cross Movement, and I’ve learned first-hand that to be relevant, the humanitarian response needs to be continuously readjusted. 
		  </q>
		  <p>
			  This is because of the complexity of the operating context, but also because of the multiple crises affecting the country such as spikes in conflict, population displacements and health emergencies which generate new needs and priorities.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  The Logistics Cluster is operational in Kinshasa and in the provincial capitals of Bukavu, Goma, Bunia, Kalémie and Kananga, providing information management and coordination to support the humanitarian actors involved in the response. Our staff on the ground regularly share useful logistics information – such as storage capacity, access updates and logistics maps – enabling responders to plan their operations while taking into consideration the available logistics capacity, road accessibility and access constraints.
		  <p>
			  The cluster has also been working on strengthening local capacity by providing training sessions dedicated to building information management, GIS and logistics skills which are critical to improving the quality of the response.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  In 2017, following the worsening of the situation in the Kasai region the cluster began facilitating access to common storage and transport services provided by WFP and Humanity and Inclusion in Kananga and Tshikapa. This scale-up of activities required additional capacity on the ground and strengthened support from the Global Support team.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  From January to June, 4,120 m<sup>3</sup> of relief items were received into storage and 6,199 m3 of cargo was transported to different locations across the country. In total, 32 organisations used these logistics services.

        <p>
            Libya has faced six years of political instability, conflict and insecurity, alongside a deteriorating public sector and economy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is estimated that 800,000 people, including refugees, migrants, internally displaced persons, returnees, non-displaced affected people and host communities, will require urgent humanitarian assistance throughout 2019. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Prospects remain uncertain in the medium and long term, while fighting and recurrent shifts in areas of control are expected to impact the humanitarian operational environment.
        </p>
        <p>
            A growing need for stronger logistics coordination and information sharing among responding actors was identified, primarily to address gaps in the overall humanitarian logistics knowledge and ensure a more coordinated operational response.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was deployed to Libya as Logistics Sector Coordinator in September after three years with the Logistics Cluster in Iraq, in order to facilitate the establishment of a centralised information sharing mechanism that could collect, analyse and share information on key logistics aspects such as the status of the entry points, supply routes, humanitarian customs procedures and other administrative processes that could cause significant delays to the arrival of relief supplies.
        </p>
        <q>
            After initial rounds of consultations with partners on the ground, I was able to institute regular coordination meetings, start mapping strategic logistics infrastructure and compile guidance and Standard Operating Procedures on customs and clearance procedures. 
        </q>
        <p>
            Based on the gaps and needs identified by humanitarian organisations, I am now working to secure common logistics services that will allow for the prepositioning of emergency stocks in the main hubs of Tripoli, Benghazi and Sebha, and for emergency distributions where needed most.
        </p>
        <p>
            Engagement and coordination among partners remains critical in identifying operational bottlenecks in this volatile environment, and in avoiding duplication of efforts to ensure the best use of available resources in-country. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To date, the Logistics Sector has connected with 26 humanitarian organisations operating across Libya, launched a dedicated webpage, held monthly coordination meetings, and produced and shared 22 information management products.

        <p>
            In early March, a severe weather system formed off the eastern coast of Mozambique, bringing heavy rains and strong winds to southern Malawi, before tracking back to the Mozambique channel. Here it intensified into Cyclone Idai which made landfall in Mozambique on 14 March, continuing to Malawi where it impacted approximately 870,000 people and caused significant infrastructure damage to the country’s south (OCHA). Through coordination, information sharing and facilitation of access to common logistics services, the Logistics Sector, co-led by WFP and the Malawian Ministry of Transport and Public Works (MoTPW), assisted the humanitarian community in their efforts to deliver lifesaving items to affected areas. 
        </p>
        <q>
            The Logistics Cluster is always the first port of call when a disaster strikes, and Cyclone Idai was no exception. In Malawi, the facilitation of Logistics Common Services was integral to the efficiency and timeliness of ShelterBox's response, while regular sector meetings provided an open platform for partners to share operational plans, discuss logistics constraints, and problem-solve solutions.
        </q>
        <p>
            The Logistics Sector facilitated access to common logistics services for the government and responding humanitarian organisations.  A total of 1,761 m3 of relief items were received for storage in five locations throughout the country. As water levels fell and road conditions improved, the Logistics Sector facilitated road transport of 1,305 mt of lifesaving humanitarian cargo.
        </p>
       <p>
		Due to both the isolated nature of some affected communities and the impact of heavy rains on road infrastructure, the Logistics Sector also facilitated transport of 3 mt of relief items by boats positioned in Bangula and Chikwawa. In addition, transport of 129 humanitarian passengers to areas cut-off by road was facilitated on WFP-chartered boats. 
	   </p>
	   <p>
		Over the course of the response, the Logistics Sector held nine coordination meetings out of a dedicated coordination cell in Blantyre, providing an information and coordination platform to emergency responders from 31 organisations (including the Department of Disaster Management Affairs, MoTPW, line ministries NGOs and UN agencies). The Logistics Sector also published a total of 55 information management products via a dedicated webpage. 
	   </p>
	   <p>
		As the situation improved, the Logistics Sector transferred all the core sector functions to the national NDMO and phased out of facilitation of common logistics services. With support from the Global Logistics Cluster, preparedness initiatives were rolled out following the Cyclone Idai emergency operation, aiming to strengthen global-regional-local networks, capacities and collaboration, before, during and after emergencies.

            A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck Indonesia’s Central Sulawesi province on 28 September 2018, triggering a tsunami and landslides that caused widespread destruction and loss of life, as well as the displacement of over 200,000 people. The earthquake affected the west coast of Donggala, while the tsunami affected the bay of Palu. In addition, the coastline of Palu City and Sigi district was affected by liquefaction.
        </p>
        <q>
            I was in Lebanon, working with the Logistics Cluster as an Information Management Officer for the Syria response, when I was asked to deploy as surge capacity to support the government-led response, so off I went, with very little notice, to my first emergency deployment.
        </q>
        <p>
            The first task was to work with the Government of Indonesia and humanitarian organisations responding to the emergency to coordinate the logistics response and provide information to actors on the ground. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime, we started assessing the logistics capacity and gaps in the affected areas. Based on our findings and the flow of relief items and the constraints in accessing the affected population, we identified the need for common logistics services. In response, WFP, as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, made road transport and temporary storage available to the humanitarian community. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We worked closely with local and international NGOs, the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI) and UN agencies including UNICEF and UNHCR. Activities were focused on facilitating access to transport and storage services for requesting organisations and governmental bodies. A fleet of 40 trucks was deployed to facilitate deliveries to different locations within Sulawesi, as well as to common warehouse facilities; 939 mt of relief items were transported using these assets. In addition, six MSUs were set-up in Garuda, in the centre of Palu city, for the onward movement of relief supplies to further destinations and in just two months 4,862 m3 of humanitarian cargo was received into storage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, we supported the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB), led by the national logistics cluster, informing government strategy as requested, and providing coordination and information management from Central Sulawesi and from Jakarta. Information on the pipeline for relief items, transport plans, existing stocks, port infrastructure and access constraints was collected and shared with relevant governmental bodies.

        <p>
            When I joined the WFP Nigeria Country Office in December 2016, Logistics Sector operations in support of the government-led response in the north-east of the country had only recently begun. Since then, the sector has provided increased support to humanitarian organisations responding to a complex crisis which affects more than 7.7 million people, many of whom are temporarily sheltered in isolated and hard-to-reach areas. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I saw the sector operation quickly evolving into a complex response entailing different services provided by different organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each month, the Logistics Sector civil-military coordination team processes approximately 500 movement notifications through the Nigerian Armed Forces. These notifications are consolidated and sorted into a weekly dispatch plan that is then used to organise humanitarian convoys. In 2018, 5,637 notifications, encompassing 17,356 trucks, were processed on behalf of 32 organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
            While en route to final distribution points, organisations can temporarily store their cargo in common storage facilities strategically located along the supply routes. These facilities are operated by ACTED, Première Urgence Internationale (PUI), INTERSOS, Solidarités International and eHealth Africa, and from January to December, 29,684 m<sup>3</sup> of relief goods were received for storage.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given the security risks and the poor road infrastructure, critical humanitarian aid such as medicines and therapeutic food supplements is also regularly airlifted from Maiduguri to remote locations throughout Borno state. PUI, in partnership with UNHAS, operates a sector-managed common road transport service in Maiduguri to collect and consolidate cargo destined for air transport, and deliver it to the airport so that it is ready to be airlifted by UNHAS to identified hard-to-reach locations. In 2018, 21 organisations arranged delivery of their cargo to UNHAS via this service.
        </p>

        <p>
            I recently re-joined the Global Logistics Cluster and, among other tasks, I am in charge of providing support to the Nigeria operation. 
        </p>
        <q>
            My knowledge of the country and of the wider humanitarian response there has proved very useful. Nigeria is a very complex operating context where needs and priorities are constantly evolving, hence we heavily rely on our staff on the ground to make the everyday choices necessary to keep our response relevant and efficient.

        <h1 class="title hidden-md-down">South Sudan</h1>
        <p>
            I joined the Logistics Cluster team in South Sudan as an Information Management Officer in September 2018, after having served in Central African Republic in the same capacity. 
        </p>
        <q>
            Despite my previous experience in a complex emergency, nothing really prepares you for a challenging, large-scale operation such as South Sudan where we provide a full range of common, integrated services.
        </q>
        <p>
            In 2018 alone, in close collaboration with OCHA and the WFP Access Unit, we coordinated 51 convoys on behalf of the humanitarian community. This figure is double what was achieved last year and is a constant effort in coordination. The convoy schedule was significantly increased between January and March to maximise the use of the roads during the dry season and to facilitate prepositioning of goods in areas that become hard-to-reach or even cut off during the rainy season. We must be both flexible and alert to maximise use the window of opportunity the dry season presents, while also minimising risks.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the physical access issues which are exacerbated by the rainy season, the Logistics Cluster also facilitates air transport all year long to priority locations through dedicated assets made available by WFP Aviation. This allowed the transport of 5,262 mt of relief cargo to hard-to-reach locations in 2018. These air services are complemented by IOM Common Transport Services which provide shunting to and from airstrips along with transport to closed sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            River transport through barges is also made available to move larger payloads of Non-Food Items. In 2018, 1,015 mt of relief items were transported along the Nile River across seven barge movements from Bor to Malakal in close cooperation with WFP.
        </p>
        <p>
            To complement transportation services, WFP, as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, has made common storage warehouses available to the humanitarian community in several locations across the country and provided MSUs for the strategic prepositioning of relief items. MSUs are a critical part of the relief supply chain - it is where the humanitarian action takes shape.

        <p>
			The Logistics Cluster was activated in Syria in January 2013. Almost seven years on, the Syrian context remained one of the most complex humanitarian crises worldwide, with an estimated 11.7 million people in need of humanitarian and protection assistance in 2019 (OCHA). In September 2014, the Whole of Syria (WoS) approach was adopted as a result of the UN Security Council Resolution 2165. The resolution brought together separate regional operations - Syria, Turkey, Iraq and up until June 2018, Jordan - into a single framework. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2019, based on gaps and needs identified with partners, the Logistics Cluster supported a total of 105 humanitarian organisations with coordination, information management and facilitation of common logistics services. This included cross-border transhipment services, inter-agency convoys, common transport, contingency fuel provision and warehousing. 
		</p>
        <q>
            I always look forward to Logistics Cluster meetings. I get to meet colleagues from other organisations and hear their concerns, difficulties and successes – it brings us closer together. During these meetings, boundaries between agencies blur and it’s almost like we all become part of the same unit, discussing and finding solutions to our shared logistics challenges. These fora can also help us to make operational decisions together, which is empowering.  
        </q>
        <p>
			The Logistics Cluster provided coordination support for cross-border operations and transhipment services from Turkey and Iraq. In Turkey, transhipment was managed by the Logistics Cluster at the crossing points of Bab al Hawa and Bab al Salam. Following a deterioration of the humanitarian situation in north-west Syria, the transhipment operation was vital to ensure that lifesaving aid reached affected populations, especially ahead of the winter. In 2019, the Logistics Cluster facilitated the transhipment of 8,033 trucks at the two crossings – almost a doubling of the number the year before. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In Iraq, The Logistics Cluster used the Al-Yarubiyah border crossing to facilitate the transhipment of humanitarian cargo, supporting UN partners with the delivery of predominantly medical items into north-east Syria. Over the course of the year, 40 trucks were coordinated for transhipment services. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout 2019, the cluster continued to support the coordination of Inter-Agency convoys in close collaboration with OCHA and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC). Four humanitarian convoys were coordinated this year inside Syria. The cluster also supported with common transport. In total, the Logistics Cluster facilitated the road transport of 10,000 mt of relief items on behalf of eight organisations. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Making use of WFP warehouses in Aleppo, Homs, Al-Hasakeh and Rural Damascus, the Logistics Cluster facilitated access to common storage services. Following a scale-up in humanitarian response needs in north-east Syria in October 2019, the Logistics Cluster also increased available storage capacity in Qamishli, as well as provided ongoing support to SARC for the augmentation of additional warehousing space in Deir-ez-Zor. Since the beginning of the year, the Logistics Cluster facilitated the reception of a total 16,559 m3 of relief items for storage. 
		</p>
		<p>
			With a complex operation spanning three countries, sharing information and coordinating between actors was paramount. In 2019, the Logistics Cluster shared 71 information management products and held 44 coordination meetings in Damascus, Erbil, Gaziantep, Antakya, and other locations within Syria. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The cluster also facilitated 13 trainings on core logistics topics across the region with a total of 369 humanitarians (319 men, 50 women) from 95 organisations participating.

        <p>
            The Logistics Cluster has been active in Yemen since June 2011, supporting humanitarian responders with information management, coordination and access to common logistics services. Throughout this period the situation in Yemen has remained volatile, conflict has escalated, and multiple crises have affected the country, including cholera outbreaks, internal displacements and natural disasters.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have been there for most of it, first on temporary assignment, then posted in Sana’a as Cluster Coordinator and saying that this is a complex emergency is an understatement; humanitarian needs are enormous and the capacity of responding organisations is strained.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2018, the cluster ensured the continued transport of relief items into the country through air services that connect Djibouti to Sana’a and sea services that connect Djibouti to Aden and Hodeidah. 1,081 mt of cargo was transported using WFP-chartered flights, and 2,430 mt of cargo was transported on board two WFP-chartered vessels, as well as dhows. Cargo has included medicines and medical equipment, vaccines, bed nets, generators, solar vaccine refrigerators, and even ambulances.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, we coordinated the transport of 12,005 mt of humanitarian supplies on behalf of 23 organisations to 288 locations across the country, and facilitated access to common warehouse facilities in Sana’a, Aden and Hodeidah, where 62,435 m<sup>3</sup> of cargo was accepted into storage on behalf of 17 organisations.
        </p>

        <p>
            The cluster also mobilised 15 MSUs for organisations to borrow and deploy where most needed, to be managed by these organisations as common storage for all interested humanitarian responders. As of December 2018, seven MSUs have been loaned to IRC, DRC, UNICEF, ADRA and WHO.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add to the complexity, following the escalation of conflict around Hodeidah in June and the subsequent increase of humanitarian activities targeting Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), the Logistics Cluster has been tasked with coordinating Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) deliveries to Humanitarian Service Points and Transit Points, established to provide IDPs with relief items. 
        </p>
        <q>
            All of these achievements, which come despite the difficulties we have faced this year, have only been possible thanks to our dedicated staff who every day take responsibility for coordinating the cluster activities on the ground, and to WFP Management’s constant support of our operations.

			The Logistics Cluster was activated in Zimbabwe in early April, following severe flooding and infrastructural damage to Manicaland Province caused by the remnants of Cyclone Idai which crossed into the country as a tropical storm on 17 March. With approximately 90% of roads and bridges in the affected areas rendered unusable, air transport was the only means of reaching cut-off populations with assistance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Logistics Cluster, through WFP, facilitated access to air transport by Mi8 helicopter for the humanitarian community. Over the course of the response, 88 mt of humanitarian cargo was transported from Mutare to 15 locations in the affected districts of Chimanimani and Chipinge. To facilitate air cargo consolidation, the Logistics Cluster also made common storage available at the airfield in Mutare where 541 m3 of relief items was stored over the length of the response. 
		</p>
        <q>
            I was in Lebanon, working with the Logistics Cluster as an Information Management Officer for the Syria response, when I was asked to deploy as surge capacity to support the government-led response, so off I went, with very little notice, to my first emergency deployment.
        </q>
        <p>
			Overall, 24 organisations were supported through coordination, information management and facilitation of access to crucial logistics services. A total of 11 coordination meetings were convened in Harare and Mutare and 46 information updates including access constraints maps were published on a dedicated webpage.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the situation improved and the response transitioned from emergency to early recovery, the Logistics Cluster scaled down its operational activities and began working towards rolling out preparedness initiatives, designed to build on lessons learned as part of the response to foster continued collaboration and communication within the humanitarian community in Zimbabwe.

		  <p>
			  In 2019, the Logistics Cluster continued to monitor the situation in Cameroon which is experiencing the impact of three distinct, complex humanitarian crises fuelled primarily by violence and insecurity. The cluster was activated in October 2018, specifically in relation to the North-West South-West crisis which saw insecurity and attacks against civilians cause mass movements of people.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  A Coordinator and an Information Management Officer were deployed to Cameroon to meet with partners and conduct a logistics gaps and needs analysis. Following consultations with humanitarian organisations working on the response as well as with the WFP Country Office, the in-country commercial logistics capacity was found to be sufficient to meet humanitarian needs and no additional cluster activities were required. The cluster was therefore moved to a dormant status.

            Ten per cent of the world's population is still living in extreme poverty and at least two billion people live in areas affected by conflict, fragility and violence. 
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            The Global Humanitarian Overview estimates that in 2019, more than 122 million people will need humanitarian assistance and protection, the majority because of the impact of conflict and violence.
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            Additionally, disasters caused by natural hazards stress economies and resilience systems. The World Bank has calculated that disasters push 26 million people into poverty every year.
          </p>

            We are witnessing extremely high levels of humanitarian needs. 
          </q>
          <p class="serif">
            While this poses a great challenge for the humanitarian community and its ability to respond, the humanitarian system is more effective and impactful today.
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            Thanks to the digital transformation of our work, to cutting-edge solutions and their application to supply chain and to satellite communication, we are better at identifying target groups, their specific needs, and we are quicker to respond when crises strike.
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            But technology cannot replace the knowledge, experience and determination of those who work every day for and with the people we serve. Their long-term commitment and dedication makes a difference that cannot and should not go unnoticed.
          </p>
          <p class="serif">
            This is why I would like the Logistics Cluster staff directly involved in our operations to tell you about our achievements in 2018. With their words and through their experiences, I am sure that you will be able to fully appreciate the breadth of our contribution to the successful implementation of humanitarian activities in some of the world’s most complex operational environments.

          <h1 class="title">STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION PLAN</h1>
          <p class="serif">
            In September 2019, the Logistics Cluster community finalised its first ever Strategy Implementation Plan for activities at the global level demonstrating the strength of the cluster partnership.
          </p>
         <p>
			As a management, monitoring and evaluation tool for global level cluster activities, the plan will strengthen accountability and enhance coordination amongst the multitude of cluster stakeholders, and increase the visibility and direct involvement of partners in cluster activities.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			The current community-driven strategy was adopted by the Logistics Cluster in 2016, but the decision to strengthen collaboration with a results-based management framework was only taken in May 2018.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			Subsequently, a dedicated Working Group led a year-long drafting process to translate the “vision” and “goals” of the Logistics Cluster Strategy for 2016-2021 into a measurable roadmap for action.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			Consultations were held with Logistics Cluster partners at the Global Meetings in Rome 2018 and Dubai 2019 with the KPI, Preparedness, and Lessons Learned Working Groups, and with the Global Logistics Cluster Support Team.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			The resulting draft plan was finalised and endorsed at the Global Meeting in Dublin in September 2019.
		 </p>
		 <p>
			Before the end of the year, 33 organisations had signed up 107 times to implement activities in the plan. Discussions on activity areas were also kicked off to capture the know-how and experience of the broader community ahead of the implementation phase starting in 2020.
