      <h1 class="title">The Logistics Cluster</h1>
      <p class="serif">
        enables global, regional and local actors to meet humanitarian needs. Before crises, we work with the stakeholders in high risk countries and regions to strengthen local capacities. In crises, where local capacities have been exceeded, we provide leadership, coordination, information and operational services.

      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        Globally, the Logistics Cluster is a community of partners actively working to overcome logistics constraints, develop and share best practices and solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The cluster approach was adopted in 2005 as a result of the Humanitarian Reform process launched by the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC). The Reform process focused on strengthening coordination and accountability, enhancing partnerships in key sectors, including Logistics.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        Because of its expertise in humanitarian logistics and its field capacity, the UN World Food Programme was chosen by the IASC to be the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster. In this role, when necessary, WFP acts as a provider of last resort offering common logistics services, to all humanitarian responders.
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The Logistics Cluster leverages the network of sixty active partners to best fill critical logistics gaps. When local infrastructures are severely damaged or inaccessible and local capacities exceeded, WFP, as the lead agency of the cluster, acts as a provider of last resort, offering assets and services to the humanitarian responders to enable them to reach the affected population. The Logistics Cluster coordinates access to common road transport services, storage facilities and fuel provided by WFP or any organisation with relevant available capacity. 
      </p>
      <p class="serif">
        The Logistics Cluster is therefore key in ensuring an efficient humanitarian response, reducing duplication of humanitarian efforts and saving costs.

      <p>The key feature of the supply chain preparedness initiative is the <strong><a href="http://unwfp.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=bc6ab99b622a4ef799b0cd0ad869b090" target="_blank">Preparedness Platform.</a></strong> </p>
      <p>
        <strong>This is an innovative dynamic mapping and analysis platform based on existing technology.</strong> It combines and leverages multiple supply chain and hazard risk datasets including satellite/drone imagery <strong>on a single visualisation interface shared by all stakeholders at an international, national and local level.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Platform can be used to simulate and plan a supply chain response, and to then adapt and rollout that plan when a disaster hits. It will help to analyse previous responses and possible future scenarios, thus supporting informed, data-driven preparedness decisions, such as the prepositioning of relief items, and the response planning efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ownership of the tool lies with the national governments and actors. WFP, as the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, manages and maintains the platform at a global level and will provide the necessary training to ensure</strong> sustainability and to strengthen national capacity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Preparedness project has been carrying out its first <strong>field-based work in Haiti since March 2017.</strong> The focus has been network engagement and partnership expansion through a multi-sectorial approach, to generate buy-in for the Preparedness Platform while testing the system’s user interface.

        <strong>In June 2016, six disaster-prone countries were identified as supply chain preparedness pilot projects – Haiti, Bangladesh, Madagascar, Indonesia, Myanmar and Nigeria. Four of the chosen countries have since been affected by large-scale emergencies. </strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="outcome-grid">
      <div class="">
        <h2>Haiti</h2>
        <p>
          The initial phases performed in Haiti have shown positive results leading up to the potential impact of Cyclones Irma and Maria. The Haitian government authorities have endorsed the approach and support to the platform in cooperation with local government, civil society and commercial stakeholders.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="outcome">
        <h2>Preparedness Platform </h2>
        <p>
          The Preparedness Platform was key in enabling the exercise. Thanks to this mapping tool, it was possible to analyse and visualise information on the logistics network, identify corridors, as well as potential bottlenecks and to graphically articulate the response.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logistics Concept of Operations were developed on the basis of local knowledge and logistics datasets contained in the Platform, including potential supply chain points of entry, logistics routes and prepositioning locations, as well as risk mitigation actions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="outcome-row">
        <h2>Madagascar</h2>
        <p>
          The key concepts of a multi-sectoral approach and the use of the preparedness platform have been then tested in Madagascar where a Logistics Preparedness Response Planning Exercise brought together twenty-seven participants from ten organisations, including the Government of Madagascar, Malagasy Red Cross, Private Sector Humanitarian Platform Madagascar, Institut Pasteur and ECHO.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three-day response planning exercise included three different emergency scenarios: two cyclones and one plague outbreak. National capacities and the potential scale and impact of the disasters were assessed, outlining supply chain capability required, potential gaps and the appropriate response actions.

          Set in motion by the World Economic Forum in 2005, the <a href="http://www.logcluster.org/logistics-emergency-teams" target="_blank"><strong>Logistics Emergency Teams (LET)</strong></a> is a partnership between the World Food Programme (WFP) and some of the largest global logistics and transportation companies, developed to improve the humanitarian response to emergencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          LET member companies deploy teams of logistics experts and provide assets and equipment to support the operational capacity on the ground. The LET has also conducted Logistics Capacity Assessments (LCAs) of high-risk areas, providing valuable information to the humanitarian community.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, the original members, <strong>Agility, A.P. Moeller Maersk, and UPS welcomed DP World</strong>, a large port operator, into the LET, enlarging the network of the partnership and strengthening its capacity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017 there was no formal LET activation, however the LET supported cluster preparedness activities in Haiti.
        </p>
        <p>
          In May, a Logistics Expert from the <strong>UPS Foundation</strong>, joined the Logistics Cluster preparedness mission to Haiti which aimed at building a multi-sectoral network and at developing the Preparedness Platform. The LET involvement in the mission was key especially to create private sector engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the Global Logistics Cluster reached out to individual members to support specific requirements in response operations in Yemen and in Bangladesh.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Yemen</strong>, in September, following the cholera outbreak and the consequent need to ensure vital medications were preserved, <strong>Agility donated a refrigerated container to store and transport anti-cholera medicines from Djibouti to Yemen aboard a WFP chartered vessel.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>Bangladesh</strong>, where the influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar created health concerns for the people hosted in the camps, the humanitarian community carried out an emergency anti-cholera vaccination campaign. <strong>Agility donated a 40-foot refrigerated container</strong>, which was placed at the Logistics Hub in Cox’s Bazar, to provide storage space for responding organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In October, <strong>DP World supported the Opex Bravo Exercise</strong>. The training hosted by the German Federal Agency for Technical Relief, the German Foreign Office and the Government of Luxembourg, was delivered by the Logistics Cluster and the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster. Trainees from 37 humanitarian organisations had access to DP World’s experts at the company’s Stuttgart operations, receiving first-hand experience of port operations and efficiency methods applied in emergency relief situations.

        <p>
          Since 1992, Cox’s Bazar continues to experience an intermittent influx of refugees from Myanmar, periodically escalating to life threatening levels when their movement, access to services and livelihoods are restricted. A new influx of Undocumented Myanmar Nationals (UMN), estimated at 655,500 as of 31 December 2017, has eroded already compromised resources in the existing makeshift settlements and refugee camps at Kutupalong and Balukhali.</p>
          <p>
            WFP, together with the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR), is co-chairing the Logistics Sector in Bangladesh, and as lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, is coordinating the Logistics Sector in Cox’s Bazar to support the logistics needs of the entire humanitarian community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main logistics constraints faced by humanitarian organisations responding to the emergency are the lack of available storage facilities and clear custom procedures, as well as the ability to prepare for the potential damages and impairments which the upcoming cyclone season may cause.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Logistics Sector has set up a Logistics Hub</strong> in the space allocated by the Government; 15 Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) for a total of 2,184 m2 have been made available for all humanitarian organisations as well as for the government, on a free to user basis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Logistics Sector has also been <strong>coordinating with the different governmental actors involved in the response</strong>, including the military, and managing and sharing information on custom procedures, access constraints and other key operational data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Logistics Sector has also been gathering and compiling information on market assessments, price monitoring and local procurement to feed into the Bangladesh Logistics Capacity Assessment (LCA).

          In 2017 conflict intensified in the East, Center and West of Central African Republic further hindering access and putting additional strain on the logistics capacity of the humanitarian community.

        </p>
        <p>
          Despite many challenges, the Logistics Cluster has been providing significant support to several infrastructure rehabilitation projects, funded through the CERF, carried out by ACTED (11 bridges, 1 ferry), Handicap International-Atlas Logistique (8 airstrips), Projet Londo (5 airstrips), and Fondation Suisse de Deminage (1 barge). These projects benefited local and international actors by allowing for safer and easier operations.

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Furthermore, the Logistics Cluster has been fostering a logistics setup that represents a best practice in inter-agency collaboration</strong> with humanitarian organisations actively participating in coordination meetings, sharing valuable operational information – consolidated in access constraints maps and other Information Management products – and providing common logistics services for the entire humanitarian community. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Common transport of relief items from Bangui, Bossangoa and Bambari is led by Handicap International-Atlas Logistique, while Première Urgence Internationale is in charge of storage in Bangui and Action Contre la Faim, Solidarités International and Handicap International manage mobile storage units loaned from WFP in Bambari, Kaga Bandoro and Bossangoa.

          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Since August, the Logistics Cluster is also facilitating a common air cargo service to deliver life-saving items in difficult-to-access areas. By the end of 2017, fourteen rotations were performed which delivered 67 mt of WASH, Shelter, Health and Logistics items to two major hot spots Bangassou and Zemio.

        <p>
          Conflict and general insecurity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have created one of the world’s most complex and long-standing humanitarian crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In order to support the humanitarian community in responding to the crisis the Logistics Cluster is operational in Kinshasa and in the provincial capitals of Bukavu, Goma, Bunia, Kalémie and Lubumbashi. </strong> It coordinates the logistical aspect of the response and provides the critical information required to improve the access and delivery of relief items to the affected population. Since violent clashes erupted in Kasai, causing a severe humanitarian crisis in the region and major displacement the Logistics Cluster has been stepping up its operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Two staging areas for the humanitarian community</strong> have been set up for in Kananga (1,520 m2) and Tshikapa (880 m2) and are managed by WFP and Handicap International-Atlas Logistique. Logistics Cluster staff are present in Kananga to help manage the supply chain and provide technical assistance to partners.
        <p>
          <strong>Road transport services have also been made available to humanitarian organisations by Handicap International-Atlas Logistique </strong> and a civil-military expert has been deployed to the Logistics Cluster to facilitate civil-military coordination.
        </p>
        <p>
          These common logistics services have been managed using the Logistics Cluster run Relief Items Tracking Application (RITA) to ensure full accountability of the cargo handled.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017, the Logistics Cluster has been also supporting the Ebola response in the Bas Uele Province. The outbreak was successfully contained thanks to rapid and coordinated operations. The cluster provided logistics coordination and Information Management at national and provincial levels and facilitated air cargo movements to the affected zones.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the Logistics Cluster has continued to work with national authorities to <strong>build institutional capacity in disaster response and mitigation</strong>, as well as to strengthen local capacities in data collection and data management with dedicated trainings in Bukavu, Butembo, Kananga, Kinshasa, Tshikapa, through which, <strong>183 people from 46 organisations have been trained</strong>.

        <p>
          As the operation to retake Mosul, which started in October 2016, created additional logistics bottlenecks, access constraints and gaps in the capacity of the humanitarian community, the Logistics Cluster significantly scaled up activities across Iraq throughout 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster has <strong>increased storage capacity and emergency airlifts in the key operational areas</strong> of Erbil, Dahuk, Baghdad, Tikrit and the Ninewa governorate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Common storage facilities have been set up throughout the Ninewa governorate within or in close proximity to displacement emergency sites and camps – with 18 logistics hubs operational during the height of the response in mid-2017. These have mostly been based along the Mosul corridor, in response to needs identified by partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          On behalf of WHO and the Health Cluster, the Logistics Cluster facilitated emergency airlifts, organised by WFP Aviation, of 30 specially equipped ambulances to Erbil, to support the humanitarian response in and around the Mosul frontlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, the Logistics Cluster has been working with humanitarian actors and authorities to establish a <strong>One Stop Shop (OSS) to facilitate and streamline the customs clearance process for humanitarian cargo within the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI)</strong>. Since it was established in December 2016, the OSS has been providing free-of-charge services to all local and international humanitarian actors. These services include facilitation of customs clearance for incoming cargo and coordination with all relevant authorities for the smooth movement of humanitarian assistance into the KRI, reducing the time required for clearance by half. <strong>On average, the OSS processes 85 clearance requests each month, representing more than US$ 12 million of humanitarian relief items</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the last year, <strong>the Logistics Cluster trained 237 people from 68 organisations across Iraq in warehouse and commodity management in emergency contexts</strong>.

        <p>
          Cyclone Enawo, a category 4 on the Saffir Simpson scale, made landfall in Madagascar’s Sava region on 7 March causing severe wind damage and widespread flooding throughout the north-eastern half of Madagascar.

        </p>
        <p>
          Following a request of the National Office for Risk and Disaster Management (BNGRC), a Logistics Sector was established. The sector identified three areas of intervention: logistics coordination, Information Management, common logistics services, including sea and river transport and storage.

        </p>
        <p>
          The logistics hubs for the response were established in the capital Antananarivo as well as in Maroantsetra and in Antalaha with storage facilities available for the humanitarian community.

        </p>
        <p>
          Sea transportation was the only way for large amount of cargo to reach these destinations, which are rather enclaved. Due to poor conditions of the road network, access via land is difficult and sometimes impossible, while air transport is hampered by the limited number and capacity of airstrips.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sea transport from Toamasina to Maroantsetra and to Antalaha was provided by WFP. Nine rotations were organised to transport relief items on behalf of twelve organisations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside BNGRC, a river transportation system was established using pirogues (dug-pout canoes), to reach over 100 remote and isolated river communities around Maroantsetra with relief items on behalf of the Education, WASH, Shelter, Nutrition, Food, Logistics and Operational Support sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Sector also supported the BNGRC with the movement of passengers accompanying cargo or conducting assessments. Two speedboats of the Corps de Protection Civile were made available to transport humanitarian staff to the affected river communities to assess needs and carry out distributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, a number of rehabilitation works were conducted in Maroantsetra in order to allow or improve access and cargo delivery.

        <p>
          The Logistics Sector in Nigeria provides support to the Government-led coordination of the humanitarian logistics response in the North-East of the country by facilitating access to common logistics services and maintaining an open forum for discussing and addressing logistics issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Logistics Sector in Nigeria represents best practice in the inter-agency collaboration, where humanitarian actors not only actively participate in the sector activities, but also take charge of the management of common storage facilities.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Inter-Agency Logistics Base in Maiduguri has a storage capacity of 2,460 m<sup>2</sup>, which includes a temperature-controlled storage area, a dedicated timber shed a kitting area and air cargo consolidation services in coordination with UNHAS operation. The site is managed by Première Urgence Internationale on behalf of the Logistics Sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other common storage sites are 1,280 m<sup>2</sup> in Monguno, managed by Solidarités International (SI), and 280 m<sup>2</sup> in Banki, managed by INTERSOS. Five additional common storage sites were being set-up by the end of the year, namely in Ngala (640 m<sup>2</sup>), to be managed by eHealth Africa, in Damasak and in Dikwa, both to be managed by ACTED, in Bama to be managed by INTERSOS and in Rann (managing organisations to be identified).
        </p>

        <p>
          Along with facilitating common storage, the Logistics Sectors also actively supports the Civil-Military coordination mechanisms established by OCHA. This support includes facilitation of cargo movements and coordination of military escort arrangements where required. Since November 2016, the Logistics Sector has facilitated, on behalf of 25 organisations, 10,889 truck movement requests for relief cargo, 6,176 of which, required a military escort.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>The Logistics Sector also works for reinforcing the logistics expertise of the humanitarian workers operating in the northeast.</strong> In 2017, 173 people have been trained in the course of nine trainings covering MSU setup, warehouse management and customs procedures.

        <p>
          In February 2017, following a prolonged drought, the humanitarian situation in Somalia rapidly deteriorated. Levels of malnutrition and drought-related disease outbreaks rose throughout the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          In response to the emergency, a Drought Operations Coordination Centre (DOCC) was established in Mogadishu. All clusters, including the Logistics Cluster, are represented within the DOCC and engaged in daily planning for the multi-sectoral response.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster has been providing <strong>essential coordination and information management to mitigate duplication of efforts by humanitarian actors and maximize the use of available logistics assets and resources</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular logistics coordination meetings have been held in Mogadishu and Nairobi to foster dialogue with other clusters and organisations, assessment missions carried out to key locations to identify logistics gaps and bottlenecks and gather data, and relevant operational information shared through the publication of route accessibility maps, supplier/transporter lists, situation updates, briefings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Logistics Cluster facilitates access to sea, road and air transportation on behalf of the humanitarian community through WFP assets.</strong>  Humanitarian supplies are being transported by sea on a monthly basis from the Port of Mombasa to Mogadishu, Berbera, Bossaso, Kismayo, and Djibouti and by road into and throughout Somalia. In addition, two WFP cargo planes have been positioned in Mogadishu to facilitate the airlift of critical humanitarian supplies.
        </p>
        <p>
          To complement transport services, WFP also made available <strong>storage facilities</strong> throughout the country, as well as two refrigerated units in the WFP complex inside of the Mogadishu International Airport, for the storage of heat-sensitive relief items.

        <h1 class="title">South Sudan</h1>
        <p>
          Over the past four years the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan has deepened and spread, affecting people in areas previously considered stable and exhausting the coping capacity of those already impacted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ongoing insecurity in conjunction with an extremely poor transport infrastructure have left the humanitarian sector with limited options to deliver lifesaving cargo to the displaced populations scattered across the country. Air and river transport are often the only means to deliver humanitarian cargo to remote locations cut off from any road access. While some road access is possible this is generally limited to the six month dry season.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Logistics Cluster has been facilitating air transport to priority locations</strong> with dedicated air assets, made available by WFP Aviation, bringing large quantities of relief cargo to hard-to-reach locations. <strong>Air services have been complemented by IOM which provides shunting services</strong> to and from the airstrips and deliveries to nearby locations, in the dry season, in the Boyond Wau and Beyond Bentiu responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster has also been coordinating access to trucking services and river transport via barge to move larger payloads of NFIs and, working closely with OCHA and WFP Access Units, <strong>facilitated 23 convoys on behalf of the humanitarian community.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To complement transportation services, WFP, as the lead of the Logistics Cluster, has made available common storage warehouses in several locations across the country and provided MSUs for the strategic prepositioning of relief items based on organisations’ needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Logistics Cluster plays a key role in South Sudan, beyond the facilitation of common services. The cluster coordinates among the numerous humanitarian organisations on the ground, fostering cooperation and best practices to overcome common logistics constraints</strong> and it has been providing capacity building training to 134 national logistics staff from the 19 organisations.

        <p>
          <strong>The Logistics Cluster facilitates access to crucial logistics services for operations across the region</strong>, following the UN Security Council Resolution 2165, which established the Whole of Syria (WoS) approach, bringing together regional separate operations – Turkey, Jordan and Syria – into a single framework. In addition, the Logistics Cluster facilitates common logistics services inside Syria.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster has been working relentlessly with relevant organisations active in the region to enhance coordination and the effectiveness of the overall response, through the provision of a set of tailored logistics services including warehousing, road and air transport contingency fuel provision and storage, cross-border coordination and transhipment services.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Inside Syria, relief cargo has been transported to affected communities, often to cut-off locations, through Inter-Agency Humanitarian Convoys. In 2017 the Logistics Cluster coordinated 55 convoys in close collaboration with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC), OCHA and UN agencies.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Air operations, using WFP assets, were facilitated to Qamishli (airlifts) until June 2017 and to Deir-ez-Zor (airdrops) until September 2017, when land access was resumed.</strong> In light of the newly established land access to these previously cut-off locations, air operations were discontinued and replaced with free to user road transport, which has been complemented with increased warehouse capacity for a total of 16,429 m² across Syria.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside the facilitation of common services, to foster the discussion on logistics bottlenecks and the development of common solutions to improve the humanitarian response among the actors active in the region, the Logistics Cluster holds regular coordination meetings in Damascus, Amman, Gaziantep and Antakya.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Logistics Cluster maintained its commitment to strengthen local capacities, training 188 people from 53 different organisations in Turkey, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.</strong>

          The Logistics Cluster has been coordinating humanitarian logistics to facilitate the delivery of life saving humanitarian assistance to the affected populations in eastern Ukraine, namely Donetsk and Luhansk non-government controlled area (NGCA) and works in close cooperation with the Humanitarian Coordinator and OCHA to advocate for improved humanitarian access and to overcome logistics bottlenecks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2017 the Logistics Cluster has been supporting the organisations working in Ukraine mostly by facilitating <strong>27 humanitarian convoys.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>The Logistics Cluster has also been assisting humanitarian actors by streamlining the complex procedures required for transport across the conflict line</strong>, advising on the required paperwork, facilitating access by providing a UN umbrella for organisations and coordinating humanitarian convoys.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the Logistics Cluster has been consolidating and sharing information on customs procedures, road access and on available logistics capacity to facilitate cargo movements and in-country access.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the cluster has been coordinating access to warehousing and cargo consolidation facilities in Dnipro (former Dnipropetrovsk) and to transport services to support the delivery of relief items to the Non-Government Controlled Areas.

        <h1 class="title">Yemen</h1>
        <p>
          Since March 2015, Yemen has seen a dramatic escalation of armed conflict that has led to mass displacements, a near-collapsed socio-economic situation, and a drastic deterioration in food security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Responding organisations have been facing critical challenges such as damaged road infrastructure, access disruptions, congestion at main entry points, limited international shipping options (especially by air) and fuel shortages. In 2017, the largest cholera outbreak ever recorded demanded a logistics scale-up to ensure that humanitarian organisations could deliver efficient and effective assistance to the affected population.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2015, the Logistics Cluster has facilitated access to common logistics services to maximise the use of available resources in-country, and avoid duplication of efforts; <strong>services include sea transport of relief items from Djibouti to Aden and Hodeidah, storage in the three hubs of Sana’a, Hodeida and Aden, overland transport inside Yemen, and fuel provision to humanitarian organisations.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster also coordinates access to chartered airlifts from Djibouti to Sana’a provided to the humanitarian community by WFP Aviation. The frequency of the airlifts increased in 2017 from almost one airlift per month in the first half of the year to a peak of four flights per week in August, due to <strong>the cholera epidemic</strong> that required urgent transport of Health and WASH cargo. From August, onward, cargo flights settled on an average of two per month.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since May 2016, the Logistics Cluster also coordinates a passenger movement service between Djibouti and Aden on the WFP-chartered vessel VOS Apollo, which transports on average more than <strong>100 passengers each month; 34 organisations (UN agencies, INGOs, NNGOs) used the service in 2017.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this common services platform, the Logistics Cluster ensured in 2017 an integrated supply chain of humanitarian cargo in support of over 50 organisations (including organisations accessing emergency fuel made available by WFP, as well as organisations using the sea passenger service).
