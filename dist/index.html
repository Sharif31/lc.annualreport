      <h1 class="title">The Logistics Cluster</h1>
      <p class="serif">enables global, regional, and local actors to meet humanitarian needs. Before crises, we work with stakeholders globally and in high-risk countries and regions to strengthen local logistics capacities. In crises, where these capacities have been exceeded, we provide leadership, coordination, information, and operational services. </p>
      <p class="serif">Globally, the Logistics Cluster is a community of partners actively working to overcome logistics constraints, and to develop and share best practices and solutions. </p>
      <p class="serif">The cluster approach was adopted in 2005 as a result of the Humanitarian Reform process launched by the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator, through the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC). The reform process focused on strengthening coordination and accountability, and enhancing partnerships in key sectors, including logistics. </p>
      <p class="serif">Because of its expertise in humanitarian logistics and its operational capacity, the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) was chosen by the IASC to be the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster. In this role, when necessary, WFP acts as a provider of last resort, offering common logistics services to all humanitarian responders. </p>
      <p class="serif">The Logistics Cluster leverages its network of active partners to best fill critical logistics gaps. When local infrastructure is severely damaged or inaccessible and local capacities have been exceeded, the Logistics Cluster facilitates access to common assets and services to humanitarian responders, enabling them to reach affected populations.  </p>
      <p class="serif">The Logistics Cluster is key to ensuring an efficient humanitarian crisis response, reducing duplication of efforts and enabling a faster intervention. </p>

			<p class="serif">The Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) usually meets face-to-face twice a year, in addition to monthly teleconferences. This year, the meetings were all held online. In addition to the regular sessions, the SAG supported the Logistics Cluster through a number of ad hoc meetings to provide guidance and advice. While the specific focus of most meetings was COVID-19, various other topics have also been discussed with the SAG. </p>

        <p>In September 2019, the Logistics Cluster community finalised its first ever Strategy Implementation Plan (SIP) for activities at global level, demonstrating the strength of the cluster partnership. </p>
        <p>As a management, monitoring, and evaluation tool for the Logistics Cluster activities at global level, the SIP will strengthen accountability, enhance coordination amongst the various stakeholders, and increase visibility and direct involvement of partners in these activities. </p>
        <p>The SIP structure is divided into four thematic: “Support to Emergency Preparedness”, “Network and Mobilise Collective Strengths”, “Support to Emergency Response”, and “Learn and Drive Best Practices” each with their own set of activities as well as specific output and outcome indicators.   </p>
        <p>A total of 33 organisations signed up in 2019 to support to the 2020 SIP, either as activity leads or contributors. Nonetheless, the 2020 implementation of the SIP has been significantly hampered by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. This has halted the vast majority of the work committed by the partner organisations and has resulted in only a few outputs and outcomes being achieved. </p>

			Since August 2017, an estimated 745,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar’s Rakhine state into Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. In 2019, the government-led response targeted 1.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including a previously existing refugee population and local host communities. In an area with high risk of natural disasters, the size and complexity of the operation requires a well-integrated and coherent inter-agency response. 
		</p>
          <p>
			Throughout 2019, the Logistics Sector in Bangladesh supported 67 humanitarian and governmental organisations with coordination, information management and facilitation of access to common logistics services such as storage. 
          </p>
          <q>
			Partnerships between universities and humanitarian workers can generate knowledge and learning for both. Academics can disseminate the results of their research through training, as well as apply their knowledge to help humanitarian workers in solving real problems.
		  </q>
		  <p class="quote">- Professor Irineu de Brito Jr. from the São Paulo State University and researcher from the Center of Innovation of Logistics System from University of São Paulo </p>
          <p>
			With availability of sufficient storage identified by partners as a critical logistics gap for the response, the Logistics Sector facilitated access to free-to-user common storage at three logistics hubs – Madhu Chara and Balukhali, provided by WFP, and at Leda, Teknaf, provided by Humanity and Inclusion/Atlas Logistique. Six temperature-controlled 20-foot shipping containers were also made available to the humanitarian community for the storage of temperature-sensitive items such as pharmaceuticals. The Logistics Sector maintained a stock of prepositioned containers and Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) available for partners. In total, 12,290 m<sup>3</sup> of relief items were received for storage on behalf of 24 partner organisations in 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
			Coordination between partners continued to be paramount to the humanitarian operation. The Logistics Sector conducted regular coordination meetings and co-chaired Health Logistics inter-sector coordination meetings with the Health Sector. The meetings provided a forum for partners to raise issues that impacted their ability to respond such as traffic control, roads management and storage constraints. Where deemed appropriate, the Logistics Sector then advocated for solutions to the issues raised on behalf of the community. In total, 32 coordination meetings and health logistics meetings were held over the course of the year. 
          </p>
          <p>
			Information remained key to the response, and the Logistics Sector worked closely with partners to collect and share logistics information to improve operational decision-making. In 2019, 103 information updates were published on a dedicated webpage and five assessments were carried out together with partners to inform the sector response. 2019 also saw the roll-out of a pilot of the Physical Roads Access Constraints (PRAC) application, allowing the humanitarian community to share and see near real-time updates on physical road access constraints in one centralised platform. 
          </p>
          <p>
			Capacity building remained a focus of the Logistics Sector in Bangladesh. A total of 10 trainings were held on topics ranging from the basics of humanitarian logistics, advance logistics training, to MSU erection, cyclone preparedness and a simulation-based workshop held as part of the Global Logistics Cluster’s Preparedness Project. A total of 233 humanitarians from 50 organisations participated in these events which also benefitted from perspectives beyond the humanitarian community through collaboration and exchanges with academia and the commercial sector in relevant areas of expertise. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
			With the ever-present threat of cyclones and monsoons adding a layer of complexity to the humanitarian response, flexibility and strong emergency preparedness planning remained important. The Logistics Sector met with partners on preparedness activities throughout the year and made contingency stock available to partners during cyclone and monsoon season, including containers and asset protection boxes.

          The Logistics Sector was activated in Bangladesh in October 2017 to support the humanitarian community in Cox’s Bazar, with coordination, information management, and common services as part of the government-led humanitarian response. The overall logistics gaps and bottlenecks that the Logistics Sector has been addressing in Cox’s Bazar district include a general shortage of available warehousing, limited commercial facilities to manage additional demands, and high utilisation of existing emergency and disaster management infrastructure.  
		</p>
          <p>
            The onset of COVID-19 in 2020 caused a rapid shift in the Logistics Sector’s activities, from an initial scale down to opening new storage facilities and addressing emerging gaps in collaboration with the government, humanitarian partners, Inter Sector Coordination Group (ISCG), and other key stakeholders. A COVID-19 Special Hub was established to support the Health Sector, with five Mobile Storage Units (MSU) and a temperature-controlled unit as surge capacity in Cox’s Bazar and Unchiprang hub, in addition to the already existing hubs in Madhu Chara, Balukhali and Teknaf in partnership with WFP and Handicap International/Atlas Logistique. As part of this partnership, the Logistics Sector also made a dedicated humanitarian truck fleet available to partners to transport COVID-19 response materials to Isolation and Treatment Centres and other response locations within the camps. Moreover, in response to government-imposed restrictions in the camps during the height of COVID-19, the Logistics Sector developed a fully digital system, the Humanitarian Access Project, to validate Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner (RRRC) approved humanitarian vehicles, in order to not only contain the spread of the pandemic to the camps but also to reduce delays and bottlenecks at checkpoints. To date, the Logistics Sector has supported 161 organisations, government bodies and suppliers through the Humanitarian Access Project. The Logistics Sector also made available six solar direct drive vaccine refrigerators for the cold storage of vaccines and medicine at Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Isolation and Treatment Centres (ITCs), of which three have been loaned out to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). 
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to ensure that the humanitarian community has access to the resources required for operational support, emergency preparedness, and minimising duplication of effort, 25 coordination meetings were organised that were attended by 58 organisations with an average participation rate of 23 people per meeting. Furthermore, as part of the capacity strengthening effort, five trainings were organised for 60 people from 23 organisations.  
          </p>
		 <p>
			To support operational decision making, respond to common logistics challenges and improve the efficiency of the logistical response, especially during the pandemic as well as the cyclone and monsoon seasons, vital information was collected on existing stocks and suppliers of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), ITC locations, ports, customs, WFP COVID-19 global transport services, as well as the impact on logistics by Cyclone Amphan. This information was shared through 67 key information products. Various assessments such as warehouse capacity, traffic count and road assessments were also carried out over the year. 
          </p>
          <p>
			Coordination between partners continued to be paramount to the humanitarian operation. The Logistics Sector conducted regular coordination meetings and co-chaired Health Logistics inter-sector coordination meetings with the Health Sector. The meetings provided a forum for partners to raise issues that impacted their ability to respond such as traffic control, roads management and storage constraints. Where deemed appropriate, the Logistics Sector then advocated for solutions to the issues raised on behalf of the community. In total, 32 coordination meetings and health logistics meetings were held over the course of the year. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of services facilitated, 13,394 m3 (7572 mt) of relief items were stored for 26 organisations and 38,479 m3 (12,573 mt) of relief items were transported for 25 organisations in 2020, using 4146 trucks. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, a total of 2535 litres of hand sanitizer was distributed among 37 organisations to facilitate office hygiene and staff wellbeing. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The Logistics Sector also prepositioned standby logistics assets including MSUs, generators, tarpaulins, sandbags and car kits across three hubs (Madhuchara, Balukhali and Teknaf hub) for partners to loan to enable rapid scale up or mitigation of disruption due to natural disasters. To date, the Logistics Sector has loaned out a variety of logistics equipment including refugee housing units, fridges, generators and MSUs to 22 partners for operational support in SARI ITCs. The Sector also supported partners with heavy machineries placing dry containers in different camps for monsoon & cyclone preparedness.
		  </p>
		  <p>
        In support of the humanitarian community, the Logistics Cluster facilitated the procurement of COVID-19 response items from the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD) for WFP, IOM and UNHCR. In collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), the Logistics Sector also facilitated the shipment of 10,000 protective gowns, donated by Join Together Society (JTS) in South Korea, from China to Bangladesh for the COVID-19 response in Cox’s Bazar using the WFP Global Aviation Service.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Moving into 2021, the Logistics Sector anticipates a cautious reduction in COVID-19 specific support activities. Coordination and information sharing will continue focusing on emergency preparedness and response, capacity building trainings and stronger engagement with national level partners.

            The Logistics Cluster was activated in Burkina Faso in October 2020 due to the needs of the humanitarian community. A Gaps and Needs Analysis (GNA) conducted in July highlighted a number of challenges in the logistics response to the humanitarian crisis affecting the country. Specifically, the GNA identified the need for reinforced coordination among the logistics community; increased storage capacity in the main areas of response; and enhanced dissemination of logistics information. 
		</p>
          <p>
            In order to address these challenges, the Logistics Cluster designed a response strategy and started the implementation of a range of activities aimed at addressing these key priorities. At regional level, coordination groups for logisticians based in Kaya (Centre-Nord region), Fada N’Gourma (Est region), Ouahigouya (Nord region) and Dori (Sahel region) were set up. At national level, the Logistics Cluster initiated regular coordination meetings to increase cooperation and information sharing among participants. Between mid-October and late December, eight of those meetings took place, which were attended by a total 73 logisticians from 20 NGOs and four UN agencies. The Logistics Cluster participated in national logistics committees and civil-military coordination discussions to ensure coordination on these levels. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To increase partners’ storage capacity, the Logistics Cluster will make available four 10 x 32 m MSUs in early 2021. These MSUs will significantly support the logistics response of the humanitarian community in the following key regions: Centre Nord, Est, Nord and Sahel. In November, the Logistics Cluster was also able to start facilitating the access to 550 m3 of free-to-use storage in Kaya. Several partners responded to this opportunity and within weeks, the entire warehouse was filled with relief items to be distributed to the most affected populations. 
          </p>
          <p>
            A dedicated Information Management Officer was deployed to work alongside the Logistics Cluster Coordinator to produce operational information management products of relevance to partners. In addition, the Logistics Cluster is implementing a partnership approach to data collection for the production of maps displaying logistics access and damaged road infrastructure. In this regard, two specialised organisations have been identified and will provide the Logistics Cluster with ready-to-use geographical data. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021, the Logistics Cluster will build on the momentum of its recent activation to scale up its services to the humanitarian community in Burkina Faso. Funding permitted, storage capacity in Kaya, Fada N’Gourma, Ouahigouya and Dori will triple and be resourced with warehouse management and cargo tracking services. The Logistics Cluster also intends to deploy temporary storage solutions close to critical areas of intervention, thereby enhancing the proximity and reactivity of the humanitarian response.

        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster in Central African Republic (CAR) was activated in 2013 following the logistics related gaps to meet growing humanitarian needs, identified through UN agencies and NGOs. The country has been facing a gradual deterioration of the situation with 2.8 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 1.9 million of whom in acute need in 2020.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Particularly, logistical challenges linked to physical accessibility are a key obstacle in delivering aid to the most vulnerable communities affected by regular shocks. Successive crises have considerably deteriorated the already limited access infrastructures, including roads, bridges and airstrips across the country, isolating entire zones. Moreover, the lack of maintenance of those infrastructures, combined with the inadequate logistics capacity (such as the lack of availability of commercial transport and local suppliers, storage spaces, etc) is especially challenging for emergency assistance during the rainy season when roads, bridges and ferries are deteriorating even faster. In addition, the volatility of the security situation is a second major factor hampering the delivery of aid in a country hit by successive conflicts, acts of banditry and activities of armed groups. Such a complex logistics environment limits dramatically the prospects to bring sufficient assistance to the most vulnerable groups who depend greatly on humanitarian assistance and protection. 
    </p>
		<p>
      In 2020, the Logistics Cluster continued working closely with partners in-country to facilitate access to common services such as storage, road and air transport to solve operational issues identified and provide coordination and information management. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To begin, common storage spaces were made available for the humanitarian community. In Bangui, two warehouses, managed by Première Urgence Internationale (PUI) on behalf of the cluster, were provided. This includes a temperature-controlled storage site for medical items and specialized nutritious food. In addition, 9 Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) were made available in the province, managed by different INGO partners and UN agencies based on their capacity and field presence. A total of 14,145 m3 of humanitarian cargo was stored over the course of the year. In Addition, Humanity and Inclusion (HI), on behalf of the Cluster, coordinates a common road transport service and in 2020, 2,562 MT of humanitarian aid was transported on behalf of 30 organizations from Bangui, Bambari and Bossangoa to various hot spots around the country. In order to support the emergency operations of organizations working with the populations most severely affected by shocks (security, natural and epidemic), the Logistics Cluster facilitates an emergency air freight service to the hardest to reach destinations by road. In 2020, 371 MT of priority cargo were transported on behalf of 31 organizations to priority zones (east and northeast mainly). Last but not least, capacity building aimed at reinforcing technical skills for national logisticians and ultimately the logistics response of the entire humanitarian community is a key area of a sustainable response. the Logistics Cluster facilitated two training courses in 2020. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the coordination role undertaken by the Logistics Cluster is a key element in the humanitarian response, helping to reduce costs, create synergies, and avoid duplication of efforts. To this end, 22 Logistics Cluster coordination meetings were held in Bangui, and logistics working group meetings were organized in the province to maintain open discussions around logistical needs. Information Management (customs, local market, accessibility mapping, etc) is another key element of the response. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2020, the COVID19 pandemic hampered some of the activities due to the sanitary restrictions. Trainings scheduled for the year had to be almost entirely cancelled due to the COVID-19 epidemic situation and infrastructure rehabilitation projects, a major focus of the humanitarian response in CAR, were delayed. Furthermore, at the height of the crisis a certain number of logistics risks were observed which could slow down the logistics chain; stockouts, border blockages, and customs bottlenecks. To support the COVID19 response, the Logistics Cluster received airlifts at Bangui airport, organized by the Global Service Provision Team in HQ, delivering Covid-19 items for humanitarian health partners working in CAR.

			In 2019, ongoing insecurity and a continuing outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) contributed to a continued volatile humanitarian situation in DRC. With 12.8 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, humanitarian organisations operated in an extremely challenging and complex environment, facing access challenges and limited logistics infrastructure. The Logistics Cluster worked with a total of 203 organisations across the country, providing key coordination and information management services as well as advocating for urgent infrastructure rehabilitation projects throughout the year. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Humanitarians working on the response in DRC are facing major access constraints across an area that is the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa. Timely and accurate logistics information provided through the Logistics Cluster is critical to strengthen operational decision-making. In 2019, a total of 237 information management updates were published on a dedicated webpage, including 97 maps detailing accessibility and other general logistics information. 
		</p>
        <q>
			We really like that the Logistics Cluster provides information management and we particularly use the cluster maps for our operations. We also really appreciate the dynamic in the working groups where we can reflect and exchange on the challenges we are facing together with the partner organisations.
		</q>

        </p>
       <p>
		Effective information sharing and coordination is also crucial to avoid duplication of efforts and to capitalise on the collective presence. The Logistics Cluster continued to work with the humanitarian community throughout the country and held 55 coordination meetings across the seven locations of Kinshasa, Goma, Bukavu, Ituri, Tshikapa, Kananga and Kalemie, where humanitarian organisations could exchange information on logistics issues and challenges. In 2019, a new mechanism was established to co-facilitate the country-level meetings in Kinshasa with an NGO. Humanity and Inclusion took up the role as the first NGO co-facilitator in-country. 
	   </p>
	   <p>
		The lack of a reliable road network across the country complicated the humanitarian response and led to high operating costs. The Logistics Cluster continued to advocate on behalf of the humanitarian community for the rehabilitation of roads and bridges as a means to improving humanitarian access both in the short and long term. 
	   </p>
	   <p>
		A total of 51 rehabilitation projects were carried out by Logistics Cluster partners over the year, including project EMIR and the rehabilitation of 1,200 kilometres of road and the runway of Tshikapa airport.

        <p>
			On 4 August, a warehouse at the port of Beirut exploded, causing widespread casualties and material damage. The port suffered considerably and surrounding commercial and residential neighbourhoods were affected too. The humanitarian community was expecting to face a number of critical logistics challenges in the required multi-agency and multi-sector response, and as such, an in-country Logistics Sector was activated in Lebanon in response to the explosion. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A dedicated Logistics Sector Coordinator was immediately deployed to Beirut after the blast, to support the coordination and information sharing with partners. In order to minimise duplication of efforts within the humanitarian community, the Logistics Sector coordinated with the Emergency Operation Cell (EOC), other sectors, agencies and humanitarian organisation, and participated regularly in meetings with the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT), Inter-Coordination Mechanism and other coordination structures. A dedicated civil-military coordination officer based in Beirut was tasked with the continuous liaising and communication with the country’s armed forces assigned to responding to the crisis, as well as foreign military actors supporting the humanitarian response. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In total, 11 coordination meetings were held in Beirut/online. These meetings served as a platform for partners to discuss common logistics challenges such as a fuel shortage and importation and customs procedures. Furthermore, three Global Calls were organised to facilitate coordination and share information on a global level, with the first meeting held on 10 August and attended by 28 organisations. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the initial days after the explosion, the Logistics Sector conducted assessments of the ports in Beirut and Tripoli and warehousing in Beirut. Findings of the assessments were shared through the coordination meetings and on the dedicated Logistics Sector website. Other information products created include detailed city maps and a map displaying the impact of the explosion through high resolution satellite imagery, which the Logistics Sector had access to thanks to the Global Logistics Cluster partnership with Airbus. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As the response developed, the Logistics Sector supported partners with the facilitation of importation and understanding of customs procedures in collaboration with OCHA. A WhatsApp group was established to support with customs procedures, with an OCHA focal point included in the group to answer any customs related queries. Various essential documents, such as tax exemption regulations, were shared through the Logistics Sector channels. Furthermore, the Logistics Sector and OCHA worked together to establish a facilitated approval process for medical cargo.

        <p>
          The Logistics Sector in Nigeria provides support to the Government-led coordination of the humanitarian logistics response in the North-East of the country. Security risks along main supply routes and poor road infrastructure, combined with the scale of the need, have created a significant strain on the logistics capacity of humanitarian responders in the affected states: Adamawa, Borno and Yobe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Sector has been supporting the humanitarian community by facilitating access to common logistics services and maintaining regular bilateral and collective engagement in an open forum for discussing and addressing logistics issues as they arise. The Logistics Sector has been also providing guidance and promoting joint inter-agency logistical planning and coordination throughout the year. The Logistics Sector in Nigeria represents best practice in the inter-agency collaboration, where humanitarian actors not only actively participate in the sector activities, but also take charge of the management of common storage facilities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Sector manages six different sites and offers a storage area of 5,160 square meters on a free-to-user basis to humanitarian organisations.  The sites are managed by Salient Humanitarian Organization in Bama (440m2), INTERSOS in Banki (640 m2), ACTED in Dikwa (640 m2) and Damasak (640 m2), Solidarités International in Monguno (1600 m2) and eHealth Africa in Ngala (880m2).  Sector-managed storage facilities received 26,647m³ (8771.172 mt) of humanitarian cargo for 21 organisations. The Logistics Sector consolidated and airlifted 185 m3 (80 mt) of cargo to various field location for 25 partner organization through the Air Cargo Consolidation service offered by the implementing partner Première Urgence Internationale (PUI) in Maiduguri. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with facilitating common storage, the Logistics Sectors also actively supports the Civil-Military coordination mechanisms established by OCHA. This support includes facilitation of cargo movements and coordination of military escort arrangements where required. The Logistics Sector processed a total of 7, 283 humanitarian cargo movement notification forms through the Nigerian Armed Forces throughout the year. These represent the proposed movement of 21, 937 trucks carrying humanitarian cargo to 73 locations on behalf of 40 organisations across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe (BAY) states.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Sector continues to provide MSU loans to augment the storage capacity of partners organizations along with the necessary installation and maintenance support. Currently 21 MSUs are loaned to 10 different partner organisations across Borno state. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Through its mailing list the Logistics Sector communicates to actors involved in the emergency response and serves as a repository of logistics information. The list has 311 subscribers from various UN agencies, NGOs, Government representatives and donors. The Logistics Sector provides support to the Government of Nigeria and the Humanitarian Community with updated information on the operating environment. In 2020, 52 information products were issued, including concept of operation, meeting minutes, operating procedures, standard operating procedures, operational overviews, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Sector also works for reinforcing the logistics expertise of the humanitarian workers operating in the northeast. Majority of the training programs offered by the sector involves face-to-face interaction and hands-on exercises often at outdoor locations. Logistics Sector’s training plans were greatly affected by the movement restriction imposed throughout the year. During 2020, the Logistics Sector trained 64 humanitarian personnel in the course of two trainings covering cargo movement refresher and orientation on child protection issues.

            Ordinarily, the region is highly dependent on sea and air transport due to its geography. The Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) are also vulnerable to tropical cyclones as well as other natural hazards such as volcanic and seismic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the region through entry point restrictions imposed by each government to keep the virus out or to slow its spread.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the year, a number of major tropical cyclones (Tino, Harold, Yasa and Zazu) affected several PICTs. Supporting the governments of affected PICTs in their response operations became more complicated because COVID-19 restrictions prevented physical deployment of personnel. Preparedness activities were similarly hampered by the restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Pacific Logistics Cluster (PLC) provided regional partners with Coordination and Information Management services linking partners’ logistics needs with available logistics services as well as promoting sharing of information on the general regional situation. The cluster also facilitated access to common logistics services to help fill gaps in commercial services such as transit warehousing in the Nadi hub, air cargo and passenger services through the WFP Pacific Air Service.  More than 220 MT (125MT freight and 95 storage) or 1,750 m3 (968 m3 freight and 782 m3 storage) of cargo and 18 passengers were facilitated on these services.

        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster was activated in the country in 2011, and since then humanitarian organisations receive logistics support enabling them to deliver humanitarian assistance in ever changing environment severely affected by poor infrastructure, seasonality, insecurity and most recently impacts of COVID-19 on supply chain resilience and access. Only last year, 190 organisations were supported with coordination, information management and common logistics services.

		</p>
		<p>
			Every year, seasonal changes increase operational costs at different times of the year and in 2020, major roads remained physically inaccessible longer than usual not only shortening the humanitarian cargo pre-positioning window during the dry season, but also increasing the reliance of humanitarian partners on costly air transport. For a second consecutive year, the Logistics Cluster team had to adjust the provision of its services to respond to the flooding emergency, affecting over 1 million people. This emergency also further exacerbated road conditions and made the Juba – Bor road inaccessible for months, critical to pre-position cargo destined to Jonglei and Upper Nile States. To address this major bottleneck the cluster coordinated, for the first time since its activation, a river movement from Juba to Bor, transporting over 160 mt of life-saving cargo. Additionally, a helicopter was deployed in order to deliver cargo from Bor to remote locations affected by flooding. 
		</p>
      <p>
        Despite physical road access constraints, the Logistics Cluster continued advocating for better planning and cargo prepositioning ahead of the rainy season which resulted in transporting 47% of cargo through road and river transport modalities, translated into a 14% decreased reliance on air operations. The Logistics Cluster achieved operational efficiencies by continuing by expanding both road and river use. In 2020, a total of 27 river movements, 10 more than in 2019, has been facilitated which enabled the transportation of 2325 metric tons of cargo through waterways. For the first time since the implementation of the Beyond Responses project, more than 1000 mt of lifesaving has been transported to deep field locations using roads. The cluster also coordinated a total of 42 humanitarian convoys along the major supply roads, which enabled partners to transport approximately 16,500 metric tons to major logistics hubs across South Sudan. 
      </p>

        <p>
          Coordination and Information Management continued to be the backbone of the Logistics Cluster support offered to partners contributing to operational decision-making and improving the efficiency of the overall logistics response. In total, 234 information products were published on the country-dedicated website, which included 52 Physical Access Constraints maps, which reflects physical status of roads and continues to be the most visited products across all the Logistics Cluster operations. The cluster also facilitated a total of 31 coordination meetings and represented logistics partners in seven national coordination mechanisms, including the Inter-Cluster Coordination Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          COVID-19 restrictions have further impacted the availability of food, fuel, and other essential goods, significantly restricting existing humanitarian operations. The Logistics Cluster South Sudan participated in the National Steering Committee on COVID-19, co-leading the Operations Support and Logistics pillar, coordinating closely with the government, WHO and other partners, as well as sharing information and guidance with partners. As part of the National Response Plan, the Logistics Cluster supported WHO with expanding bed capacity at the Dr John Garang multi-purpose Infectious Diseases Unit by donating and installing a mobile storage unit at the site. Furthermore, the cluster-managed common storage capacity in Juba was close to tripled to accommodate the anticipated high volumes of COVID-19 supplies. In order to ensure scarce in-country stocks of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) were prioritized across the country to meet the needs of the COVID-19 response, the Logistics Cluster launched the central storage and management of PPE on behalf of the humanitarian community in South Sudan. As a result, more than 3.2 million PPE items were allocated by the COVID-19 Inter-Agency Technical Team and dispatched by the Logistics Cluster in Juba to 93 organisations from the common pool created by IOM, WFP and WHO.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to COVID-19 global pandemic, Logistics Cluster trainings were put on hold since March 2020. However, only in January and February, 230 participants from 96 organisations attended 8 physical/onsite sessions. Since March, the Logistics Cluster South Sudan actively encouraged participants to access a free e-learning platform featuring a selection of logistics trainings available to Logistics Cluster partners globally.

        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster was activated in Syria in January 2013 and In September 2014, the Whole of Syria (WoS) approach was adopted as a result of the UN Security Council Resolution 2165. The resolution brought together separate regional operations into a single framework. Eight years on, the Syrian context remains one of the most complex humanitarian crises worldwide, with an estimated 11.7 million people in need of humanitarian and protection assistance in 2019 (OCHA).
		</p>
		<p>
			In 2020, the Logistics Cluster supported 77 partners including UN agencies, NGOs INGOs and national societies responding regionally to the Syria crisis by facilitating access to crucial free-to-user logistics services. Information management and GIS collaboration led to the development of new IM products, maps and data collection tools to ensure physical access updates in the northwest ahead of the winter season.
		</p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster continued to provide critical support to the cross-border responses through the facilitation of Security Council-authorised cross-border transhipment services for UN agencies delivering humanitarian cargo to areas of Syria inaccessible from inside the country. Over the course of 2020, 12,082 Syrian trucks were transhipped from Turkey to Syria transporting just over 264,000 mt of humanitarian assistance through both Bab al-Hawa and Bab al-Salam border crossings. This is the highest number of truck transhipments recorded since transhipment operations began in 2014. 
        </p>
        <p>
          These achievements were made despite COVID-19 restrictions in Turkey and despite cross-border operations shrinking significantly. With the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2504 (2020) in January and Resolution 2533 (2020) in July, the border crossings of Al-Yarubiyah and Bab al-Salam respectively were excluded for UN transhipment operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside Syria, access to a total storage capacity of 7,850 m² was secured to cover storage gaps in four strategic locations inside Syria, receiving over 16,000 m3 (equivalent of more than 480 x 20’ containers) valued at xx into storage 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster also supported the humanitarian community through donations and loans of logistics assets such as MSUs and one generator.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2020, no inter-agency convoys took place due to security concerns and the fact that approvals were not granted by all involved parties.
        </p>
        <h2>COVID-19</h2>
        <p>
          With the declaration of COVID-19 as global pandemic on 11 March 2020, operations changed in line with the overall response. Coordination meetings moved online, and trainings could not be held.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, a series of comprehensive COVID-19 preventive measures were put in place at the transhipment hubs. The Logistics Cluster doubled the Bab al-Hawa transhipment hub space from 5,000m2 to 10,000m2 and tripled office space to ensure physical distancing measures were fully implemented for all workers, drivers and staff operating at the hub.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside Syria, the cluster received USD 200,000 from the SHF reserve allocation for the COVID-19 response to put in place and facilitate access to free-to-user air cargo transport services from Damascus to Qamishli to fast track the delivery of Health sector cargo, avoiding lengthy and cumbersome processes related to overland land transport.

        <p>
          After six years of brutal conflict, Yemen continued to retain the dismal record of largest humanitarian crisis in the world. Driven by escalating conflict and a protracted economic crisis, humanitarian needs continued to grow, leaving more than 80 percent of the population in need of humanitarian assistance and protection. The situation was further exacerbated by torrential rains, a severe fuel crisis, the threat of desert locusts and the COVID-19 pandemic. Fuel shortages from June onwards, especially felt in northern governorates, aggravated the humanitarian situation, reducing essential services and the transport of essential goods and restricting humanitarian operations, already severely hampered by a huge funding shortfall.<em>(source: OCHA)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Logistics Cluster has been active in Yemen since June 2011 and has since continued to adapt to the persistently volatile operating environment in order to support humanitarian responders through coordination, information management, and access to common logistics services. In January 2020, a Gaps and Needs Analysis that had been initiated in 2019 was completed and it informed the revision of the Logistics Cluster Concept of Operations (ConOps). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Operating across three main hubs in Aden, Al Hodeidah and Sana’a, the Logistics Cluster supported 61 partners with coordination, information management and facilitation of access to common logistics services such as air cargo transport, sea cargo transport, inland road transport and storage of relief items.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the aim to maximise the use of available logistics resources in-country for the timely and effective delivery of humanitarian aid and avoid duplication of efforts, coordination meetings were held throughout the year - the majority of which online due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 63 information products were published on the dedicated operation webpage, which received 11,000 pageviews. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster facilitated the transport of a total of 29,484 m3 of cargo by air and sea into Yemen and by land across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          Challenges affecting road transport between the south and the north of the country persisted throughout 2020. Furthermore, since June road transport services in the north of the country had to be ceased. Despite the challenges, the Logistics Cluster overall facilitated the road transport of 27,110 m3 of humanitarian supplies on behalf of 16 organisations, covering 29 locations across 9 governorates and 20 districts.
        </p>
        <p>
          In close coordination with partners, the air cargo transport departure point was shifted from Djibouti to Dubai, with connections to Sana’a and Aden. Over the course of the year, 480 m3 of cargo was airlifted through WFP-chartered flights on behalf of 12 partners. 97% of airlifted cargo was health-related.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Logistics Cluster facilitated the transport by sea of 1,894 m3 of humanitarian cargo on behalf of 15 organisations. For 1,118 m3 of these, the Logistics Cluster covered the costs for the Jeddah-Al Hodeidah leg of transport on behalf of partners – in recognition of the existing gap in containerized sea transport options serving Al Hodeidah seaport. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The two WFP-chartered vessels, VOS Apollo and VOS Theia, continued to play a crucial emergency rescue and evacuation role by remaining on stand-by at Aden and Al Hodeidah seaports, as per the in-country Security Management Team (SMT) request. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Across Aden, Bajil and Sana’a, 25,638 m3 of humanitarian cargo was received into common storage on behalf of 17 partners. In addition, the Logistics Cluster facilitated the loan of 10 MSUs to 5 organisations to ensure increased storage capacity when and where needed. The Logistics Cluster expanded its common storage capacity in Bajil, specifically to accommodate urgent health-related items to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, the expansion was provided through Mobile Storage Units (MSUs); in the last quarter of the year, a new warehouse was secured in order to facilitate additional dedicated common storage space for partners. The new facility will open at the start of 2021 and will bring the total common storage capacity across Yemen to 14,880 m2.

			The Logistics Cluster was activated in Zimbabwe in early April, following severe flooding and infrastructural damage to Manicaland Province caused by the remnants of Cyclone Idai which crossed into the country as a tropical storm on 17 March. With approximately 90% of roads and bridges in the affected areas rendered unusable, air transport was the only means of reaching cut-off populations with assistance. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The Logistics Cluster, through WFP, facilitated access to air transport by Mi8 helicopter for the humanitarian community. Over the course of the response, 88 mt of humanitarian cargo was transported from Mutare to 15 locations in the affected districts of Chimanimani and Chipinge. To facilitate air cargo consolidation, the Logistics Cluster also made common storage available at the airfield in Mutare where 541 m<sup>3</sup> of relief items were stored over the length of the response. 
		</p>
        <q>
			Collaboration and coordination between UN agencies in particular and all the developing partners in general is becoming increasingly critical as the world faces formidable challenges of climate change, displacements due to conflicts or natural disaster and inequalities both within and between countries. Logistics Cluster support during emergency response helps to save valuable lives as well as allows us to make maximum use of growingly scarce resources, be it funding, fuel etc. I also link it to smaller carbon footprint with the spirit and approach  of ‘do no harm’. 
		</q>
		<p class="quote">
            - Tabinda Syed, Supply and Logistics Manager, UNICEF Zimbabwe
        </p>
        <p>
			Overall, 24 organisations were supported through coordination, information management and facilitation of access to crucial logistics services. A total of 11 coordination meetings were convened in Harare and Mutare and 46 information updates including access constraints maps were published on a dedicated webpage.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the situation improved and the response transitioned from emergency to early recovery, the Logistics Cluster scaled down its operational activities and began working towards rolling out preparedness initiatives, designed to build on lessons learned as part of the response to foster continued collaboration and communication within the humanitarian community in Zimbabwe.

			<h1 class="title">Haiti</h1>
			<p>
				Since the deactivation of the Logistics Cluster in June 2012, Haiti has a formal functional logistics sector under the leadership of the DGPC (General Directorate of the Civil Protection) and WFP as co-lead, providing coordination and information management services. In 2020, the logistics sector has been resuming its coordination support with the arrival of the Covid19 in Haiti and has provided regular meetings at capital level since in order to share key logistics information and updates. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Since October, with the arrival of a Preparedness officer, the logistics sector has been gradually shifting its focus into Preparedness actions, initiating some information tools and the updates of LCA sections through field missions.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, a GNA (Gaps and Needs Assessment) has been performed in October, which has highlighted key gaps, such as improving access to key logistics information, road access constraints and lack of suitable storage infrastructure throughout the country, and a need to reinforce the coordination mechanism at decentralized level.
			</p>
			<p>
				There is a need to improve the access to updated logistics capacity information, specifically in the mapping of infrastructures, the identification of partners’ strength and weaknesses which is part of the core requirements of the Preparedness project.
			</p>
			
			<h1 class="title">Libya</h1>
			<p>
				In 2020, the Logistics Sector has continued to provide coordination platform and logistics information sharing to the humanitarian community operating in Libya. The Logistics Sector activities focused mainly in supporting the appropriate coordination platform as well as providing logistics information sharing to allow humanitarian community (i) to have access to up to date and relevant logistics information, (ii) make sure that available in-country logistics resources are used, and (iii) avoid duplication of efforts. 
			</p>
			<p>
				In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, the Logistics Sector in Libya with the support of the Global Logistics Cluster has conducted a Gaps and Needs Analysis to advise on the most efficient logistics coordination mechanisms to address the current constraints faced by responders in-country. Due to the exceptional international measures affecting movements of staff, the analysis was conducted remotely in April and May 2020. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the Gaps and Needs Analysis methodology, consultations and interviews were conducted with 16 humanitarian organizations at country and global level in order to assess existing and potential logistics gaps, constraints and needs for which a Logistics support might be requested by partners involved in the Libya response and preparedness. The key recommendations of the analysis can be summarized as follow: To deploy a dedicated Logistics Sector coordinator in order to reinforce the coordination as well as the information sharing of relevant logistics information within humanitarian partners; to support and strengthen the Logistics Sector coordination mechanism in Libya as well as enhancing coordination with other relevant technical supply chain-related working group (Access and Procurement) and other relevant coordination mechanisms/forum (ICC), specifically in the area of logistics information sharing; to raise partners’ awareness on to the supply chain resources already made available by WFP and partners; and to build the capacity of partners in the technical area of Logistics through the provision of trainings. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Gaps and Needs Analysis report was shared with the HCT and OCHA for possible advocacy with the donors in order to secure necessary funding for the Logistics Sector activities for the next 6 months (including Logistics Sector Coordinator position and Information Management activities). Unfortunately, funding shortfall did not allow to secure appropriate resources in 2020.

			<h1 class="title">Sudan</h1>
			<p>
				Since 2011, Libya has been affected by political, security and economic volatility and the humanitarian situation is increasingly complex. In 2019, 893,000 people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance including internally displaced persons, returnees, non-displaced conflict-affected people and host communities, refugees and migrants. Violence during 2019 saw further displacement (OCHA). Humanitarian organisations faced a number of challenges to effectively deliver relief items, especially due to security and access constraints around Tripoli and in the east and south of the country. The Logistics Sector supported the humanitarian community with coordination and information management to facilitate operational planning amidst volatility.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2019 the Logistics Sector published 36 information updates and organised eight coordination meetings for partners out of Tunis from where the international community is supporting the response. Partners also worked together to maintain a flexible network and facilitate quick sharing of information. Three organisations served as regional focal points to support logistics working groups operating out of the east, west and south – Première Urgence International (PUI), Cesvi and International Medical Corps respectively. PUI also moderated a Skype group, allowing Logistics Coordinators to exchange relevant logistics information in real time. In response to a request, the Logistics Sector facilitated the storage of 163 m<sup>3</sup> of humanitarian relief items.
			</p>
			
			<h1 class="title">VENEZUELA </h1>
			<p>
				The Logistics Cluster was activated in-country to support the humanitarian response to the crisis. Due to the absence of WFP in Venezuela, OCHA has been acting as lead agency with support from the Global Logistics Cluster in Rome. A Logistics Cluster Coordinator was deployed for most of the year 2020, managing remotely from July onwards due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Regular coordination meetings are held to support the exchange of information between the 43 registered organisations. The cluster, through various means of communication, such as social media groups and mailing lists, tries to support the sharing of practical logistical information among its partners. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Cluster continues its coordination and support activity with information management, providing updates and reports in terms of logistical capacity, restrictions and access. This includes guidelines and mechanisms within the framework of the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The Cluster supported the compilation and dissemination of information for the repatriation flights organized by embassies, cargo flights of the Humanitarian Air Bridge from the EU and humanitarian flights organized by the World Food Program to Venezuela, from its operational centre in Panama.

			LLocal responders and field-based initiatives are at the centre of the Logistics Cluster Preparedness Project, which has as its primary objective the strengthening and localisation of national humanitarian logistics. The project works collaboratively with national responders – government, non-government, academia and the private sector – to build sustainable outcomes based on a common, localised and autonomous approach. The project is intended as a catalyst, kick-starting a capacity-strengthening process which is then continued by other organisations once the Project ends.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			The Covid-19 pandemic threatened ongoing project activities and rollout planning, primarily through reduced access to key national stakeholders, understandably concerned with the immediate response activities, and the reduced ability of project staff to deploy and to interact with counterparts. In spite of this, the project took significant steps forward in 2020. Work commenced in an additional xx countries (Nepal, xxx); activities continued in most active countries – albeit with some delays.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Looking first at the Asia-Pacific region: April saw Cambodia finalising the recruitment and deployment of a Preparedness Expert, who has since been advocating for an increased focus on logistics preparedness by national actors, and has supported them with stakeholder mapping activities and coordination mechanisms. In May, the Bangladesh National Humanitarian Logistics Action Plan, developed during the 2019 gap-analysis workshop, was endorsed by the NDMO (Ministry for Disaster Management and Relief). Discussions are underway with on next steps. Activities continued in Laos, led by the national Preparedness Officer. A ToR for a National Logistics Preparedness Working Group was developed and circulated to stakeholders, and is currently with the NDMO (Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare) for endorsement. The action plan, developed in 2019, was discussed by stakeholders in an NDMO-led workshop. Government officials were trained in warehouse management, and have since led the training of their colleagues across 18 provinces nationally. Work in the Philippines was significantly constrained due to covid-19-related lockdowns, and changes to key government staff. The national Preparedness Officer nevertheless was able to support the government for several natural disaster responses, and has continued to build relationships with key interlocuters. Recruitment of a Preparedness Expert for Nepal was completed in November, with deployment underway in January 2021. The planned start in Bhutan had to be postponed to 2021 due to government constraints on staffing. In the Pacific, as with previous years, preparedness localisation initiatives were undertaken under the lead of WFP, through the Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) cluster system.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			  Moving Africa and the Middle East: In Iraq, the project conducted a regional Gap Analysis Workshop in Erbil covering the Kurdish Region of Iraq at the beginning of 2020, to be followed by similar event in 2021 in Bagdad covering Federal Iraq in early 2021. These will result in a common roadmap covering the entire country. In Madagascar, the national logistics working group was actively involved in the coordination and response of the floods that affected the northern part of the country. The project has continued to support the NDMO (BNGRC – Bureau National de Gestion des Risques et des Catastrophes) with its prepositioning strategy. This strategy proved critical in 2020, with the country affected by floods in the north and drought in the south. Throughout the year, the project has been working with the BNGRC to fully transition the project to the Government and ensure sustainability. The Malawi Ministry of Transport and Public Works – the lead for the national logistics sector – endorsed the Action Plan developed during the 2019 Gap Analysis Workshop, and stakeholders started implementation of the action plan’s activities. In Mozambique, a Provisional Logistics Working Group was established in Pemba in the Capo Delgado province. This was followed by a Gaps Analysis Workshop conducted in the same province with the provisional authorities and humanitarian actors. A Plan of Action of the National Logistics Preparedness project was approved by the INGC (INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE GESTÃO DE CALAMIDADES) directorate. National and provisional level logistics working groups were merged into a single national logistics sector working group under the leadership of INGC in order to improve coordination. South Sudan’s scaleup of the project from the EVD (Ebola Virus Disease) preparedness to national logistics preparedness was put on-hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project instead focused on supporting the humanitarian community with COVID-19 preparedness and response. Since the project commenced in Zimbabwe at the beginning of 2020, a Logistics Preparedness Working group has been established, a Gap Analysis Workshop conducted, and an Action Plan developed by the working group has been endorsed by the Department of Civil Protection. Kenya, Tajikistan, and Sierra Leone were identified as candidate countries in early 2020 by the Logistics Cluster Preparedness Working group. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the rollout of the project in these countries has been delayed by eight months. In December 2020, the NDMOs in the three countries endorsed the implementation of the project in their respective countries. The project is planned to be rolled out in early 2021 across the three countries, with Tajikistan likely to commence in late January.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			In the Americas: 2020 marked the start of Preparedness activities in the Americas despite the severe impact of COVID-19 and Hurricanes Eta and Iota in candidate countries. At the beginning of year, a scoping mission was conducted in Colombia to officially start the project. A few months after, the Preparedness Expert started chairing the Logistic Working Group focussing on transitioning from response coordination to preparedness activities in 2021. In Haiti, Preparedness activities resumed through the deployment of a Preparedness Expert who has been actively engaged in starting to transition the work of the Logistics Sector to a Preparedness Working Group in coordination with the NDMO (DGPC). Later in the year, the Regional Preparedness Officer for the Americas started developing a regional strategy and engaging with key actors to ensure the scope of the Project is tailored to the realities of the region where the private sector is strong and the primary need is to focus on building long-lasting relationship between different stakeholders. In the last months of 2020, Honduras and Guatemala host organisation officially accepted to initiate the Project in 2021 in the framework of the response transition and lessons learned from Eta/Iota Hurricanes.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			At the global level, two major milestones were achieved in 2020. First, for Log:IE - an information exchange platform for logistics preparedness, readiness and response coordination and information sharing. The platform supports the humanitarian supply chain through timely provision of logistics information. It is anticipated to be rolled out to the targeted field preparedness countries for 2021, based on a ‘Minimum Viable Product’ that has been developed and tested in eight different countries as pilot phases.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Second, a detailed Institutional Capacity Strengthening Framework was finalised. This framework, built on a foundation of detailed guidance documentation and templates, aids officers in taking a sustainable approach to capacity strengthening and activity monitoring at the country level. Adopting a consistent set of metrics, while still remaining flexible across a wide range of country contexts, allows a global picture of the project’s contribution to increased localisation to be defined. The framework, and the lessons learned during its implementation in upcoming countries in 2021, will form the core of the Project’s other global deliverable, the Preparedness Guide.  As this approach is rolled out to new project countries in 2021, the supporting capacity strengthening documentation will be updated to reflect experiences and lessons learned. This will form the core of the project’s global-level deliverable, the Preparedness Guide, which aims to support other global partners as they undertake capacity strengthening activities, in line with the grand bargain agreements to support localisation of activities.
